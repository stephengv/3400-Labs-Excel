["software.html", "Software 0.2 Data 0.3 R 0.4 Excel 0.5 SPSS 0.6 JAMOVI", " Software 0.2 Data Data files used for the labs are all taken from open data sources. Links are provided for each lab. For convenience, all of the data files are also available here as single files in the github repository for this lab manual 0.2.1 Data Repository https://github.com/CrumpLab/statisticsLab/tree/master/data 0.2.2 CSV format All of the data files in .csv format are also available to download as a .zip file 0.2.3 SPSS format All of the data files in SPSS format are also available to download as a .zip file 0.3 R In this course we will be using R as a tool to analyze data, and as a tool to help us gain a better understanding of what our analyses are doing. Throughout each lab we will show you how to use R to solve specific problems, and then you will use the examples to solve homework and lab assignments. R is a very deep programming language, and in many ways we will only be skimming the surface of what R can do. Along the way, there will be many pointers to more advanced techniques that interested students can follow to become experts in using R for data-analysis, and computer programming in general. R is primarily a computer programming language for statistical analysis. It is free, and open-source (many people contribute to developing it), and runs on most operating systems. It is a powerful language that can be used for all sorts of mathematical operations, data-processing, analysis, and graphical display of data. I even used R to write this lab manual. And, I use R all the time for my own research, because it makes data-analyis fast, efficient, transparent, reproducible, and exciting. Statistics Software SPSS SAS JMP R Julia Matlab 0.3.1 Why R? There are lots of different options for using computers to analyze data, why use R?. The options all have pros and cons, and can be used in different ways to solve a range of different problems. Some software allows you to load in data, and then analyze the data by clicking different options in a menu. This can sometimes be fast and convenient. For example, once the data is loaded, all you have to do is click a couple buttons to analyse the data! However, many aspects of data-analysis are not so easy. For example, particular analyses often require that the data be formatted in a particular way so that the program can analyze it properly. Often times when a researcher wants to ask a new question of an existing data set, they have to spend time re-formatting the data. If the data is large, then reformatting by hand is very slow, and can lead to errors. Another option, is to use a scripting language to instruct the computer how reformat the data. This is very fast and efficient. R provides the ability to everything all in one place. You can load in data, reformat it any way you like, then anlayze it anyway you like, and create beautiful graphs and tables (publication quality) to display your findings. Once you get the hang of R, it becomes very fast and efficient. 0.3.2 Installing R and R Studio Download and install R onto your computer. The R website is: http://www.r-project.org Find the download R using the link. This will take you to a page with many different mirror links. You can click any of these links to download a version of R that will work on your computer. After you have installed R you can continue. After you have installed R on your computer, you should want to install another program called R studio. This program provides a user-friendly interface for using R. You must already have installed R before you perform this step. The R-studio website is: http://www.rstudio.com Find the download link on the front-page, and then download R studio desktop version for your computer. After you have installed R studio you will be ready to start using R. The website R-fiddle allows you to run R scripts in the cloud, so you can practice R from your web-browser! 0.3.3 R studio notes and tips Figure .: The R-studio workspace 0.3.3.1 Console When you open up R studio you will see three or four main windows (the placement of each are configurable). In the above example, the bottom left window is the command line (terminal or console) for R. This is used to directly enter commands into R. Once you have entered a command here, press enter to execute the command. The console is useful for entering single lines of code and running them. Oftentimes this occurs when you are learning how to correctly execute a line of code in R. Your first few attempts may be incorrect resulting in errors, but trying out different variations on your code in the command line can help you produce the correct code. Pressing the up arrow while in the console will scroll through the most recently executed lines of code. 0.3.3.2 Script Editor The top left corner contains the script editor. This is a simple text editor for writing and saving R scripts with many lines. Several tabs can be opened at once, with each tab representing a different R script. R scripts can be saved from the editor (resulting in a .r file). Whole scripts can be run by copy and pasting them into the console and pressing enter. Alternatively, you can highlight portions of the script that you want to run (in the script editor) and press command-enter to automatically run that portion in the console (or press the button for running the current line/section: green arrow pointing right). 0.3.3.3 Workspace and History The top right panel contains two tabs, one for the workspace and another for history. The workspace lists out all of the variables and functions that are currently loaded in R’s memory. You can inspect each of the variables by clicking on them. This is generally only useful for variables that do not contain large amounts of information. The history tab provides a record of the recent commands executed in the console. 0.3.3.4 File, Plot, Packages, Help The bottom-right window has four tabs for files, plots, packages, and help. The files tab allows browsing of the computers file directory. An important concept in R is the current working directory. This is file folder that R points to by default. Many functions in R will save things directly to this direct, or attempt to read files from this directory. The current working directory can be changed by navigating to the desired folder in the file menu, and then clicking on the more option to set that folder to the current working directory. This is especially important when reading in data to R. The current working directory should be set to the folder containing the data to be inputted into R. The plots tab will show recent plots and figures made in R. The packages tab lists the current R libraries loaded into memory, and provides the ability to download and enable new R packages. The help menu is an invaluable tool. Here, you can search for individual R commands to see examples of how they are used. Sometimes the help files for individual commands are opaque and difficult to understand, so it is necessary to do a Google search to find better examples of using these commands. 0.3.4 How to complete the R Labs Each of the labs focuses on particular data-analysis problems, from graphing data, computing descriptive statistics, to running inferential tests in R. All of the labs come in three parts, a training part, a generalization part, and a writing part. The training part includes step-by-step examples of R code that solves particular problems. The R code is always highlighted in grey. The generalization part gives short assignments to change parts of the provided code to solve a new problem. The writing part tasks you with answering questions about statitiscal concepts. The way to complete each lab is to open a new R Markdown document in R-studio, and then document your progression through each of the parts. By doing this, you will become familiar with how R and R-studio works, and how to create documents that preserve both the code and your notes all in one place. There are a few tricks to getting started that are outline below. Open R-studio 0.3.4.1 R projects Create a new R project Go to the file menu and select new project, or go to the top right-hand corner of R-studio, you should see a blue cube with an R in it, then select New project from the dropdown menu Save the new R project somewhere that you can find it. If you are working on a lab computer, then save the new R project to the desktop. What is an R project? When you create a new R project you are creating two things, 1) a new folder on your computer, and 2) a “.Rproj” file. For example, if you gave your R project the name “Lab1”, then you will have created a folder title “Lab1”, and inside the folder you will find an R project file called “Lab1.Rproj”. As you work inside R-studio you will be creating text documents, and you will be doing things like loading data, and saving the results of your analyses. As your work grows and becomes more complex, you can often find yourself creating many different files. The R project folder is a very useful way of organizing your files all in one place so you can find them later. If you double-clik an R project file, R-studio will automatically load and restore your last session. In the labs, you will be using your R project folder to: save data files into this folder save R-markdown files that you will use to write your R-code and lab notes save the results of your analysis 0.3.4.2 Installing libraries When you install R and R-studio, you get what is called Base R. Base R contains many libraries that allow you to conduct statistical anlayses. Because R is free and open-source, many other developers have created add-on libraries that extend the functionality of R. We use some of these libraries, and you need to install them before you can do the labs. For example, in any of the labs, whenever you see a line code that uses the word library like this library(libraryname), this line of code telling R to load up that library so it can be used. The libraryname would be replaced with the actual name of the library. For example, you will see code like this in the labs: library(data.table) This line of code is saying that the data.table library needs to be loaded. You can check to see if any library is already loaded by clicking on the “packages” tab in the bottom right hand panel. You will see many packages listed in alphabetical order. Packages that are currently loaded and available have a checkmark. If you scroll down and find that you do not have data.table installed, then you need to install it. To install any package follow these steps: Click on the packages tab Find the “install” button in the top left hand corner of the packages tab. Click the install button Make sure “install from:” is set to CRAN repository Make sure “dependencies” is clicked on (with a checkmark) type the name of the library into the search bar. As you type, you should see the names of different packages you can install pop-up in a drop-down menu. You must be connected to the internet to install packages from CRAN Once you find the package (e.g., data.table), click it, or just make sure the full, correctly spelled name, is in the search bar Press the install button You should see some text appear in the console while R installs the package. After you have installed the package, you should now see that it is listed in the packages tab. You can turn the package on by clicking it in the package tab. OR, you can turn the packge on by running the command library(data.table) in the console, to do this type library(data.table) into the console, and press enter. 0.3.4.3 Quick install If you are using R on one of the lab computers, you may find that some of the packages are not installed. The lab computers get wiped everynight, so it may be necessary to install packages each time you come back to the lab. Fortunately, we can tell R to install all of the packages we need in one go. Copy the following lines of code into the console, and press enter. Note you can select all of the lines at once, then copy them, then paste all of them into the console, and press enter to run them all. After each of the packages are installed, you will then be able to load them using library(). install.packages(ggplot2) install.packages(dplyr) install.packages(data.table) install.packages(summarytools) install.packages(gapminder) install.packages(ggpubr) 0.3.4.4 R markdown Once you have the necessary packages installed you can begin creating R markdown documents for each lab. We admit that at the beginning, R markdown documents might seem a little bit confusing, but you will find they are extremely useful and flexible. Basically, what R markdown allows you to do is combine two kinds of writing, 1) writing R code to conduct analyses, and 2) writing normal text, with headers, sub-headers, and paragraphs. You can think of this like a lab journal, that contains both your writing about what you are doing (e.g., notes to self), and the code that you use for analysis. Additionally, when your code does something like make a graph, or run a statistical test, you can ask R markdown to print the results. The R markdown website has an excellent tutorial that is well worth your time to check out: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html 0.3.4.5 R markdown lab templates We have created a set of template documents for each lab that can be downloaded here: download lab templates. When you unzip the file you should find the following: A new folder titled “RMarkdownsLab” Inside the folder you will see the “RMarkdownsLab.Rproj” file A data folder containing data files for the labs A “LabTemplates” folder containing the R markdown templates for each lab. To get started with Lab 1, follow these steps: copy the template file for lab 1, “Lab 01 Graphing_Student Name.Rmd”, and place it into the “RMarkdownsLab” (copy it out of the template folder, and into the RMarkdownsLab folder). Rename the file to add your own name, eg., “Lab1GraphingMattCrump.Rmd” double-click the “RMarkdownsLab.Rproj” file R-studio will now load up. If you click the files tab, you will see all of the files and folders inside the “RMarkdownsLab” folder Click on your lab1 .rmd file, it will now load into the editor window. Each lab template .rmd file contains three main sections, one for each part of the lab. You will write things inside each section to complete the lab. 0.3.5 Screencast tutorial Follow this guide to get up running for Lab 1. 0.3.6 R-studio Cloud R-studio is also in the cloud. This means that if you want to use R and R-studio through your web-browser you can do that without even installing R or R-studio on your computer. It’s also free! sign up for an R-studio cloud account here: https://rstudio.cloud You can make new R projects, work inside them, and everything is saved in the cloud! To see how everything would work, follow the steps in this video. You will need to download this .zip file to your computer to get started The link to the video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsbnV0t7FE4, or you can watch it here: 0.4 Excel 0.5 SPSS 0.6 JAMOVI "],
["lab-1-graphing-data.html", "Chapter 1 Lab 1: Graphing Data 1.1 General Goals 1.2 Excel", " Chapter 1 Lab 1: Graphing Data Whoops —Edward Tufte As we have found out from the textbook and lecture, when we measure things, we get lots of numbers. Too many. Sometimes so many your head explodes just thinking about them. One of the most helpful things you can do to begin to make sense of these numbers, is to look at them in graphical form. Unfortunately, for sight-impaired individuals, graphical summary of data is much more well-developed than other forms of summarizing data for our human senses. Some researchers are developing auditory versions of visual graphs, a process called sonification, but we aren’t prepared to demonstrate that here. Instead, we will make charts, and plots, and things to look at, rather than the numbers themselves, mainly because these are tools that are easiest to get our hands on, they are the most developed, and they work really well for visual summary. If time permits, at some point I would like to come back here and do the same things with sonification. I think that would be really, really cool! 1.1 General Goals Our general goals for this first lab are to get your feet wet, so to speak. We’ll do these things: Load in some data to a statistical software program Talk a little bit about how the data is structured Make graphs of the data so we can look at it and make sense of it. 1.1.1 Important info Data for NYC film permits was obtained from the NYC open data website. The .csv file can be found here: Film_Permits.csv Gapminder data from the gapminder project (copied from the R gapminder library) can be downloaded in .csv format here: gapminder.csv 1.2 Excel Have you ever gotten home (or to Brooklyn college) to find orange cones preventing you from parking because yet another film shoot has been issued a permit to take up the entire block with trucks and trailers? Today we are going to take a look at some data collected by the New York City government, about filming permits issued in the last several years. 1.2.1 Goals Today I will walk you through techniques to make several different types of graphs in excel, that will help us quickly visually summarize a large set of data. You will learn to: Count occurrences of variables in cells Make bar graphs of this data Construct a histogram using the data analysis tool pack Write a brief interpretation of our findings The data we will look at today contains 14 different variables of information about 50728 different film permits issued by the city in the last several years. That is a lot of data, and can be pretty intimidating at first glance. Trying to wrap our heads around any meaning of patterns in this data seems like a daunting task. This is why statistics and graphs are awesome. Statistics and graphs are short cuts that help complicated trends and patterns hidden in large sets of numbers become obvious to the human eye / brain. Before we get started, let’s load up the data, and you can see what I mean. 1.2.2 Load the data Download the data as a .csv file from section 1.3 above (INSERTLINK 1.3) Open the downloaded file in excel Save the file as an Excel document File → Save As… filetype: .xlsx name: personalize the file name so you will recognize this as your own copy of the data (maybe: Lab1_YourName) 1.2.3 Inspect the data When you open the Excel file, you will see many rows and columns of data. Each row (except row 1) contains data corresponding to one filming permit (what we might think of as a “subject” in this case). Row 1 however, contains the names of each variable, which we call the “Header” row. Each column contains data for a single variable, for every subject. Using the bar on the right edge of your screen, scroll through the data a bit and take a look. I’ll wait…. Did you find anything cool in there? Notice any patterns about where, when, how long film permits are issued for? No! Of course you didn’t! Right now our data is just a giant mess of numbers! Way too many numbers!!! This is the fundamental reason why graphs and statistics are awesome. We are going to distill meaning that is easily and quickly identifiable out of this hot mess of numbers. Our analysis goals for this walkthrough are: Create a bar graph that displays the number of permits issued in each borough. Create a bar graph that displays the number of each type of permit issued in Brooklyn. Create a histogram that displays the lengths of time that these permits are valid for. 1.2.4 Preparing the data 1.2.4.1 Creating blank worksheets First, we will create a blank worksheet for each of the graphs we will be producing today. Click the “+” button on the worksheet tab bar to create a new worksheet Right click on the new worksheets tab and select “rename” Give the sheet a meaningful name, maybe “BarGraph - Borough” Repeat steps 1-3 until you have 3 blank worksheets, one for each graph. Rename each one with a sensible name 1.2.4.2 Create a working copy of the data We will now copy to each of these sheets just the data we will need to complete each graph. In Excel, there are often many paths to the correct answer/graph/statistic. The method I am about to show you is very clean and organized, but as you get more experience with excel, you might find ways to take shortcuts and skip some of these steps For each of our 3 graphs, and 3 corresponding worksheets, we will need different variables: Graph Variables needed Bar graph by Borough Borough Bar graph by type, Brooklyn only Borough and Category Histogram of permit duration StartDateTime and EndDateTime Go to the worksheet named “Film_Permits” that contains the original data by clicking its’ name on the worksheet tab bar (near the bottom of your screen) click on the letter “H” above the column named “Borough”. This will select the entire column of data Press ctrl+c to copy this data to the clipboard (or right click the data you selected and then click “copy”) Go to the worksheet where you will create the first bar graph. Click cell “A1” Press ctrl+v to paste this data from the clipboard (or right click “the data you selected”A1&quot; and then click “paste”) Repeat this process until all three of your new worksheets contain the variables mentioned in the table above. 1.2.5 Bar graph by borough The first graph we create will be a bar graph. The (horizontal) x-axis of this graph will display each of the five boroughs. The vertical) y-axis of this graph will display the frequency, or number, of film permits issued per borough. 1.2.5.1 Calculate Values to graph First click the tab of the worksheet where you placed only the “Borough variable” to make that sheet active. In order to generate this graph, we first need to calculate how many permits were issued in each of the five boroughs. Starting in column C, Row 1, (as in Cell C1), write the name of one of the 5 boroughs. Let’s start with “Brooklyn”, because. In the cell to the right of C1, aka D1, write “Bronx”. Keep going to the right, and write the labels “Queens”, “Manhattan”, and “Staten Island” In cell C2, write or copy/paste the formula: =COUNTIF(A:A,C1) Press enter. You should now see that the cell C2 now displays 15389. This is the total number of film permits issued in Brooklyn over the past several years. The “CountIf” function takes two inputs, separated by a comma. The first input tells the function “Where should I count stuff?” and the second input tells the function “What should I count there?”. So “=COUNTIF(A:A,C1)” translates to “Search through the whole A column (A:A), and count each cell if it equals whatever is in cell C1 (Brooklyn)”. The help files inside excel are pretty great at explaining how different functions work. you can quickly access the help file on any function by type it into a cell and clicking its name. See the video below. Repeat this process to under each of the four other borough labels. You should end up with: 1.2.5.2 Create and customize the graph Now that we have our data, we can go about making our graph. Press down the left mouse button on C1 (where it says “Brooklyn”) and hold drag your mouse to the right until you have highlighted all five borough names, and down until you have selected both the labels and the data. Release the mouse button (I’m so glad I remembered to include this step. You could have ended up holding the mouse button down forever!). Click the “Insert” button on the menu ribbon near the top of your screen Click the “column chart” button to insert a column chart. And there we go! ’We have a bar graph! Now let’s play with some of the graphs options to make it look a little more presentable. Select your graph Click the “Design” button on the menu ribbon Click “add chart element”. From this menu you can add and remove features from your graph. Click “Axis labels” to add labels to both your vertical and horizontal axes. Now your graph will have the words “Axis title” along both the bottom and left edge. Click into these text boxes and give the axis a sensible label (maybe “Film Permits” and “Borough”) Play with the other settings and options in the design ribbon. There are a lot of options on how to present a graph. The most important thing to remember is that a graph should be as easy to read as possible. Try not to include things that are redundant, or don’t add to the point you are trying to make. On other words, this: Not this: 1.2.6 Bar graph by type, Brooklyn only Now we are going to make a similar graph, but this time we are going to look at the types of permits being issued, but only in Brooklyn (leaving the other lesser boroughs out of it for now). Because we only want to count each category in only one borough, we are going to have to use the =COUNTIFS function this time around. 1.2.6.1 Calculate Values to graph Click the second worksheet we created before, the one that we pasted the Borough and Category variables to. Create a label for each type of category, starting in cell D1 and moving to the right. (Commercial, Film, Still, Photography, Student, Television, Theater, WEB) Write “Brooklyn” in cell C1 in Cell D2, write the function: =COUNTIFS(A:A,C1,B:B,D1) Countifs will only count rows that meet all of its’ criteria. Its usage is =countifs(where to count 1 , what to count 1, where to count 2, what to count 2 ). The function we just entered translates to: Search through the borough variable (column A) and count all the rows that say “Brooklyn” (C1), then search through those rows in the category variable (column B), and count all the ones that say “Commercial” (D1) Remember to check out the excel help on countifs. Repeat this function for each of the other category labels (Television, etc.) your result should look like this: 1.2.6.2 Create and customize graph Highlight the data we just calculated Click the “Insert” button on the menu ribbon near the top of your screen Click the “column chart” button to insert a column chart. Give it axis labels, and make any other design changes you think make the graph easier to read. 1.2.7 Histogram of permit duration We will now make a histogram of the duration of each of these permits. A histogram is a lot like a bar graph, except histograms are used for continuous variables (like length of time), and bar graphs are used for categorical variables (like borough or category). The biggest visual difference is that the bars in a bar graph have space between them, while a histograms bars touch each other. 1.2.7.1 Install the data analysis toolbox We will use the data analysis toolbox to construct this graph. The data analysis toolbox is a free add on for Microsoft excel. Most university computers will already have this installed. To check if the data analysis toolbox is installed: Click “data” in the menu ribbon if the data tab contains a section called “analysis”, and a “data analysis” button, then the toolbox is installed, and you can proceed, if not follow these instructions to install the toolbox. 1.2.7.2 Calculate Values to graph Click the third worksheet we created before, the one that we pasted the Start Date and End Date variables to. In cell C2, to the right of the first start/end date pair, type the formula: =B2-A2 Subtracting the start data from the end date will give us the number of days the permit was issued for. a value of “.25” means that the permit was valid for 6 hours (.25 * 24 hours in a day) Now we need to copy paste the formula into column C next to each row of data. But since this data set holds over 50,000 rows, selecting all of that data manually would be tedious. I’m going to use so keyboard shortcuts here, that make it ver easy to move around large sets of data in excel. Start by click the cell we want to copy (C2, where we put the subtraction formula) press ctrl+c to copy that formula. Press the left arrow once to move to cell B2 Hold the ctrl button and press the down arrow. This will “jump” the cursor down to the end of the data. When you hold ctrl, arrow keys move the cursor to the last piece of data in that row or column, before a blank cell. Now release the ctrl button, and press the right arrow once, moving the highlighted cell to C50729. Hold ctrl+shift+up arrow. This makes the cursor jump back up to our formula, and holding shift make it highlight all cells between the start and end of the jump press ctrl+V to paste our formula in the cells we just selected. Learning to use the arrow keys, ctrl, and shift to move around and highlight data in Excel can turn a 2 hour analysis into a 20 minute analysis, and is a great skill to practice. An Excel champion very rarely needs to touch their mouse. 1.2.7.3 Create and customize graph 1.2.7.3.1 Create bin labels Now that we have the duration of each permit, we can start to put it together for use in a histogram. In order to do this, we will need to define the “bins” (x-axis units) of our histogram. In cell E2 type the number “0” Now in the cell below 0, write the formula = E2+.1 Copy this formula in the spaces below, until the final result = 3 (days) 1.2.7.3.2 Data analysis toolbox - Histogram Click the “data” button in the menu ribbon Click the “data analysis” button Select the “histogram” option Next to “input range”, click the cell selection button Using the mouse, click the label “C” at the top of the column containing the permit duration values. Press enter Next to “Bin Range”, click the cell selection button Using the mouse, highlight the bin values we created in step 3. Press enter Make sure the check mark next to “Chart output” is selected In the output section, select “New Worksheet” and enter a name (maybe “Permit Duration - Histogram”) Press enter Excel will now create a new worksheet that has a frequency table, using the bins we provided, and a histogram of that data. We could have created this chart the hard way, using a =COUNTIF function, but the data analysis toolbox did a lot of the work for us in this example. Now you can edit the visual appearance of the graph. At the very least, we need to make all the bars touch one another, to make it clear to that this is a histogram and not a bar graph. Right click on one of the bars of the graph and select “Format data series” In the window that appears, set “gap width” to 0 1.2.8 Reporting and interpreting our results Figure 1 Figure 1 shows the number of film permits issued in each of the last 5 boroughs over the last several years. From this graph we can see that in Manhattan and Brooklyn, over 15000 permits have been issued over this period. Queens has also had a high number of permits issued, Whilre very few permits have been issued in the Bronx and Staten Island. Figure 2 Figure 2 shows the number of film permits issued in Brooklyn, broken down by category of permit. Here we can see that the vast majority of filming that goes on in Brooklyn is for television projects, with film projects a distant second. Figure 3 Figure 3 is a histogram of the duration of time that film permits issued in NYC are valid for between .6 and .7 days. This number makes sense, as that is the approximate length of an average working day. The data set contains ~ 1000 outliers, which are permits in the “more than 3 days” category. 1.2.9 On Your Own Create a bar graph that shows the frequency of each category of film permit across all five boroughs. Create 4 more bar graphs of the frequency of each category of film permit in each of the other four borough (beside the one we already made for Brooklyn) Create a histogram of the time between the date a permit was entered into the NYC system (EnteredOn) and the start date of the permit (StartDateTime) In one to two pages, discuss what you see in these graphs, and what you can learn about film permits in NYC with all the graphs you made today. Be sure to label each graph, and make specific references in your text to each of the graphs, explaining how/what that graph has to say. "],

It’s sort of an abstract silliness, that sometimes the joke isn’t the star. —Dana Carvey The purpose of this lab is to show you how to compute basic descriptive statistics, including measures of central tendency (mean, mode, median) and variation (range, variance, standard deviation). 2.1 General Goals Compute measures of central tendency using software Compute measures of variation using software Ask some questions of a data set using descriptive statistics 2.1.1 Important info We will be using data from the gapminder project. You can download a small snippet of the data in .csv format from this link (note this dataset was copied from the gapminder library for R) gapminder.csv 2.2 Excel In this lab you will explore a set of freely available data gathered by the GapMinder Project, that describes the wealth and life expectancies of several countries over the last ~60 years. Using descriptive statistics you will write a general account of this data, making evidence supported claims about life expectancy and wealth in several countries. Calculating basic descriptive statistics. Interpret these statistics and use them to make data based decisions. Report and support your decisions in writing In this lab we will attempt to answer the following questions: In which North American country (Canada, Mexico or United states) does the typical citizen live the longest, over the years measured? In which North American country has life expectancy changed the most since 1952? 2.2.1 Statistics Covered Measures of central tendency Name Formula Mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) = \\(\\frac{\\sum X}{N}\\) Median The middle number Mode The most frequent number Measures of variability Name Formula Maximum The largest number Minimum The smallest number Range Maximum - Minimum Sum of Squares \\(SS_{X}\\) = \\(\\sum X^2\\) - \\(\\frac{(\\sum X)^2}{N}\\) Standard Deviation Population \\(\\sigma=\\frac{SS_{X}}{N}\\) Sample \\(s=\\frac{SS_{X}}{N-1}\\) Variance Population \\(\\sigma^2\\) Sample \\(s^2\\) 2.2.2 Load the data Download the data as a .csv file from above Open the downloaded file in excel Save the file as an Excel document File → Save As… filetype: .xlsx name: personalize the file name so you will recognize this as your own copy of the data (maybe: Lab2_YourName) 2.2.3 Sort and Split Because the questions ask about specific countries, we need to “split” the given data in order to easily calculate the required descriptive statistics. You should now see the data organized into rows and columns in the open excel workbook. Each column contains a single variable The first row contains “headers” which label the variable in each column Each row contains all the information gathered from a single measurement (a specific country in a specific year) Looking at the bottom of the excel window, you should see that this workbook (another name for a excel data file) currently only contains one worksheet (a “page” within a workbook) named “GapMinder” 2.2.3.1 Splitting the Data by Country On the “sheet bar” at the bottom of the Excel window, click the “+” in order to add a new blank sheet to the workbook. Right click on the tab of the work sheet you just created, and name it after one of the countries you want to separate the data by (i.e. “Canada”). Repeat steps 1 and 2 until you have created a blank worksheet for each North American country. Click on the “GapMinder” worksheet. Press the control key and the letter “A” (Ctrl+A) twice, to select all data on the sheet. Click the “Data” button on the tools ribbon on the top of the screen, and then click the “sort” button. In the sort dialogue, make sure the “my data has headers” box is checked, and set “sort by” to “Country”. Then click “OK” Click on the “GapMinder” worksheet. click the row number next to the header row (1) to select that row Press ctrl+c to copy that row to your clip board go to each of the worksheets you created, and use ctrl+v to paste the header info into the first row of each sheet. Left click and hold on the row number of the row containing the first “Canada” measurement Continue to hold down the left mouse button, and drag downwards until you have selected all of the rows containing measurements from Canada. Press CTRL + C to copy these rows to your clipboard Go to the Canada worksheet you created by clicking its’ tab on the worksheet bar. Select cell A2 Press CTRL + V to paste in that data you copied from the original sheet. Repeat steps 12-16 until you have copied each North American country’s data to the appropriately labeled worksheet. Your data is now ready for analysis 2.2.4 Calculate Descriptive statistics We will now calculate the mean, median, N, Max, Min, Range, and Standard Deviation of life expectancy and GDP for each country. Click the tab of the “Canada” worksheet. Scroll down to the final row of the data Skip one row, and in a blank cell in the column containing the “Life” variable, type: =average( Now using your mouse, left click and hold on the bottom data point in the “LifeExp” column. Continue to hold down the left mouse button and drag upwards until you have selected all of the data on the Bronx work sheet in the fine amount column, and release the left mouse button In order to finish your function, type: &gt; ) Press enter and the cell you have been typing in should now display the life expectancy for Canada since 1952. (Hint: It should equal 74.9) Repeat steps 2-6, replacing “average” with: median, count (N), max, min, stdev.s (standard deviation of a sample). To calculate range, subtract the minimum value from the maximum value. Repeat steps 1-8 for the GDP variable, and each other country. You have now calculated all of the descriptive statistics required to complete this assignment. For easier referencing of these values, I suggest you copy all the statistics you have calculated into a table, where each row is a borough, and each column is a different statistic. Remember to label all of your work and round appropriately! Your result should look like this: Statistic Canada Mexico United States Mean | 74.9 | 65.4 | 73.5 Median | 75.0 | 66.2 | 74.0 Count | 12 | 12 | 12 Max | 80.7 | 76.2 | 78.2 Min | 68.8 | 50.8 | 68.4 Standard Deviation | 3.95 | 8.19 | 3.34 Range | 11.9 | 25.4 | 9.80 2.2.5 Interpert our results In which North American country (Canada, Mexico or United states) does the typical citizen live the longest, over the years measured? Since 1952, Canadian citizens have enjoyed a higher average life expectancy (74.9) than citizens of either Mexico (65.4), or the United States (73.5). This is pattern is also found in the median, minimum and maximum life expectancy in all three of these countries, as seen in the table above. In which North American country has life expectancy changed the most since 1952? Since 1952, Mexican citizens have experienced the most change in life expectancy (SD=8.19) than citizens of either Canada (3.95), or the United States (3.34). This is pattern is also found in the range of life expectancy in all three of these countries, as seen in the table above. 2.2.6 Conditional Function Method Optional Bonus Learning! There are many other ways to complete this assignment in excel, that are more complicated but much quicker. Advanced students may be interested in reading the Excel help file on the SUMIF and COUNTIF functions. Additionally, the below function is a example of a truly general conditional function, where A was the column containing the “county”, or grouping variable, D1 contained the country of current interest, and B was the column containing the “LifeExp’, or the dependent variable. =MODE(IF(\\(A:\\)A=D1,\\(B:\\)B)) 2.2.7 On Your Own Using the same strategy as above, answer these two questions and create a descriptive statistic table, using the GDP variable, which measures these countries health, instead of their life expectancy. In which North American country (Canada, Mexico or United states) does the typical citizen have the most wealth, over the years measured? In which North American country has wealth changed the most since 1952? Once you have answered these questions, write a short paragraph discussing how these numerical findings relate to your own hypothesizes, beliefs, and ideas about these 3 countries. "],
["lab-3-correlation.html", "Chapter 3 Lab 3: Correlation 3.1 General Goals 3.2 Excel", " Chapter 3 Lab 3: Correlation If … we choose a group of social phenomena with no antecedent knowledge of the causation or absence of causation among them, then the calculation of correlation coefficients, total or partial, will not advance us a step toward evaluating the importance of the causes at work. —Sir Ronald Fisher In lecture and in the textbook, we have been discussing the idea of correlation. This is the idea that two things that we measure can be somehow related to one another. For example, your personal happiness, which we could try to measure say with a questionnaire, might be related to other things in your life that we could also measure, such as number of close friends, yearly salary, how much chocolate you have in your bedroom, or how many times you have said the word Nintendo in your life. Some of the relationships that we can measure are meaningful, and might reflect a causal relationship where one thing causes a change in another thing. Some of the relationships are spurious, and do not reflect a causal relationship. In this lab you will learn how to compute correlations between two variables in software, and then ask some questions about the correlations that you observe. 3.1 General Goals Compute Pearson’s r between two variables using software Discuss the possible meaning of correlations that you observe 3.1.1 Important Info We use data from the World Happiness Report. A .csv of the data can be found here: WHR2018.csv 3.2 Excel Today we are going to take a look at some data collected as part of the World Happiness Report (WHR), and quantify some relationships within that data using both correlation (Pearson’s r) and scatter plots. The World Happiness Report is a yearly report that is funded by the United Nations (and other organizations), that attempts to quantify the quality of life of people in different countries around the globe. By examining this data for patterns and relationships, we can gain insight into what political and cognitive factors make groups of people self-identify as being happy or not. You can read more about the WHR at their website. 3.2.1 Goals The analysis I am going to walk you through today is meant to answer the question: Was there a relationship between people’s perceptions of their freedom to make choices about their own life, and their confidence in their national government in 2017? If so, what did this relationship look like? We are going to answer this specific question by calculating and interpreting Pearson’s r, and creating a scatter plot and best-fit line to visualize the relationship. After we go over how to answer this question, I will leave you with a few more questions about this data, to answer on your own, using the techniques you’ve learned in this lab. 3.2.2 Load the data Download the data as a .xls file from the WHR. Open the downloaded file in excel Luckily, the data is already in .xls format, which is the standard Excel format, so we don’t need to convert the data at all. When you open the Excel file, you will see many rows and columns of data. It looks like a mess at this point, but the first thing we are going to do is clean it up, so that we are left with just the information we need to answer the question above. The first thing I want you to notice is that at the bottom of your worksheet, there is a horizontal gray bar, which contains several “tabs” that correspond to different worksheets of data contained in this file. The only one that we need for this lab is labeled “Table2.1”, so let’s delete the rest of them: 3.2.3 Removing unnecessary worksheets Right click on the first worksheet’s tab you want to delete (lets go from left to right, so first right click “Figure 2.2”) Select “delete”&quot; from the menu that appears Repeat this process until all the worksheets other than “Table2.1” are gone. Now let’s take a closer look at the “Table2.1” worksheet. 3.2.3.1 Resizing columns for a cleaner display Each row in this file represents a specific country, during a specific year. The first two columns tell us what country and year the rest of that row is referring to. You might notice that in the first row, there are labels that identify the information in each of the columns. These are called “variable names”, or “headers” if you want to sound fancy. You might notice that some of the variable names are cut off, because that specific column is not wide enough to display the whole name. To fix this for your entire worksheet at once: Press “ctrl+a”, twice OR click the little sideway triangle between the “1” that labels row 1 and the “A” that labels column A (either of these methods will select ALL the data on the sheet for you. every row and every column) Now double click the little line between the column A and B column labels You should see that all of the columns have now changed width to be big enough to display their entire name. This is an odd trick, and much easier to understand in the video below. If you are interested in how each of these variables was measured / calculated, you can read about them here. 3.2.3.2 Create a working copy of the data This study measured many dependent variables, but for now we will analyze only the “Freedom to make life choices” and “Confidence in national government” variables, found in columns G and L, respectively. It is a good practice to always keep an unedited copy of the raw data. Now that we have gotten rid of the other worksheets, let’s make ourselves a fresh empty worksheet, and copy just the data we need on to it. Click the “+” button on the worksheet tab bar to create a new worksheet Right click on the new worksheets tab and select “rename”&quot; Give the sheet a meaningful name, maybe “Freedom-Confidence 2017” Select the “Table2.1” worksheet Click the letter “A” column label to select all of column A Press ctrl+c to copy (or right click the selected data and select copy) Go to the worksheet we just created Select cell A1 Press ctrl+v (or right click A1 and select “paste”) to paste the “Country” variable into column A of our new worksheet. Repeat steps 5-9, but now copy the “Year”, “Freedom, and”Confidence&quot; variables from Table2.1 columns B, G, and L, to columns B, C and D of our new worksheet. Now we have a worksheet with only four variables, which should be much more pleasant on the eyes. However, we still have more data than we need. The question above asks specifically about these two variables in 2017, and we currently have the data from every year that was recorded in the overall data set. To remove the data from years we are not interested in: 3.2.3.3 Sort the data and remove unnecessary rows Press ctrl+a, twice. (select all data) Click the “data” tab in the menu ribbon Click “sort” to open the sort dialogue Sort by the “year” column. (Make sure “my data has headers” is checked, because your data has headers) Choose the “largest to smallest” order Press “ok” Left click and hold down the mouse button on the row number of the first row with data from 2016, and drag down until all of the non 2017 data is selected Press the “delete” button (or right click the highlighted data and select delete) WooHoo! Our data is all nice and organized and sorted. Now let’s start the hard part! Calculating r and creating a scatter plot of these two variables. 3.2.4 Calculate Pearson’s r, and the coefficient of determination Select a blank cell somewhere on the worksheet with the 2017 freedom and confidence data. In that cell type “Pearson r” (This is a label to remind ourselves what we are calculating in that area) In the cell directly below this label type: =CORREL(C2:C142,D2:D142) Press enter. And r is calculated! Jeez… It’s just not fair, how much math we have to do in this class! 3.2.5 Generate a scatter plot Select the column containing the “Freedom” variable by clicking the letter at the top of its column. Hold the ctrl button, and select the column containing the “Confidence” variable (now both columns should be highlighted) Click the “insert” button on the menu ribbon at the top of the screen Click the scatter plot button (the image looks like a tiny little scatter plot) And we have a scatter plot! Let’s give it proper axis titles, and a descriptive plot title like “Relationship between self perceived of freedom of choice and confidence in the national government worldwide - 2017”. I also hate color, so I played with the plot settings a bit, made it black and white, and simplified the look of it. Now, we will also add a best fit line, to highlight the linear trend in this data. 3.2.5.1 Adding a best fit line to a scatter plot Select your graph by left clicking it. (Sometimes if you already have a graph object selected, you first need to click out of the graph by clicking any empty cell) Click the green “+” symbol that will appear to the left of your graph Click the checkbox next to the “trendline” option. This “best fit” or “trend line” is the line that comes as close as possible to each point in the data set. It’s helpful for visually estimating how the y-axis variable changes relative to the x-axis variable. one can also visually estimate the r value of two variables, based on how close to this best fit line the points fall (If two variables share a correlation of 1, the data will all fall on the best fit line, because they share a perfect linear relationship) 3.2.6 Interpreting our results We discovered a moderately strong positive correlation between peoples experience to freely make life choices, and their confidence in their national government, as measured across 140 different countries in 2017 (r(140)=.44)(Figure 1). This suggests that people across the world who are more confident in their government, also feel freer to make choices. It is possible that this is a causal effect (good government makes on feel free, or vice versa), but the correlational evidence presented here is not enough for us to draw that conclusion. It is also possible that other outside variables, such as economic or social forces, may be motivating this correlation. As always, there is a chance this correlation is spurious (due to chance), but this is unlikely in this case, due to the large size of our r value, and our large N. 3.2.7 On Your Own Calculate and r value and create a scatter plot between the same variables we used here, but for the year 2014 Calculate an r value and create a scatter plot between a different pairs of variables in this data set, for only the 2017 data In one to two pages, report and interpret you calculations and scatterplots "],

["lab-5-fundamentals-of-hypothesis-testing.html", "Chapter 5 Lab 5: Fundamentals of Hypothesis Testing 5.1 Overview 5.2 Excel", " Chapter 5 Lab 5: Fundamentals of Hypothesis Testing The null hypothesis is never proved or established, but is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation. Every experiment may be said to exist only to give the facts a chance of disproving the null hypothesis. —R. A. Fisher 5.1 Overview From here on out in the labs we will be focusing on making sense of data from experiments. In all of this, we use experiments to ask a question about whether one thing causes change (influences) another thing. Then, we look at the data to help us answer that question. In general, we expect to find a difference in our measurement between the conditions of the experimental manipulation. We expect to find a difference when the manipulation works, and causes change in our measure. We expect not to find a difference when the manipulation does not work, and does not cause change. However, as you well know from reading the textbook, and attending the lectures. Experimental manipulations are not the only thing that can cause change in our measure. Chance alone can cause change. Our measures are usually variable themselves, so they come along with some change in them due to sampling error. At a minimum, when we conduct an experiment, we want to know if the change we observed is bigger than the change that can be produced by chance. Theoretically, random chance could produce most any change we might measure in our experiment. So, there will always be uncertainty about whether our manipulation caused the change, or chance caused the change. But, we can reduce and evaluate that uncertainty. When we do this, we make inferences about what caused change in our experiments. This process is called statistical inference. We use inferential statistics as tools to help us make these inferences. In this lab we introduce you to foundational concepts in statistical inference. This is also commonly termed hypothesis testing. But, for various reasons using that language to describe the process is tied to particular philosophies about doing statistical inference. We use some of that language here, so that you know what it means. 5.2 Excel 5.2.1 Goals In this lab, we will use Excel to: Calculate difference scores between pairs of measures Conduct a sign test on this data Create an excel sheet that will make calculating future sign tests much easier 5.2.2 Load the data The data we will examine today is from a fictitious experiment based on the infamous Coke vs. Pepsi Taste Test Challenge. 20 blindfolded participants were presented with two cups of soda (Coke and Pepsi). Presentation sequence was randomly determined, and participants were required to rate the taste of the soda on a scale from 1-5. First, let’s open the relevant data file; Here is the link; it is called PepsiCoke.sav. The “.sav” file extension means that this data is formatted for a different software (SPSS), so the first thing we will have to do is copy the data to a blank excel workbook Open Excel Select “Blank Workbook” Open “PepsiCoke.sav” in SPSS Highlight the two columns of data by clicking the left most column label with you mouse, and draging right until both columns are selected. Press ctrl+c to copy this data Switch to excel, and click cell A2 Press ctrl+v to copy this data to excel Label each column in row 1. 5.2.3 Calculate difference scores between pairs of measures Now for each participant let’s calculate, the difference between the rating they gave for Coke vs. Pepsi. We will use SPSS to create a new variable (in a new column) containing only difference scores. In cell C1 enter the label “differences” In cell C2 enter: =A1-B1 Copy this formula downward until all difference scores are calculated 5.2.4 State the hypotheses The Alternative hypothesis H_a_ = People prefer Coke over Pepsi or people prefer Pepsi over Coke The Null Hypothesis: H_0_ = People prefer Coke and Pepsi equally. 5.2.5 Determine the observed value We will now convert these difference scores into a binomial variable, which is required for a sign test (“Pluses and minuses” or “Ps and Qs” or “Heads and tails”) In cell E1 write the label “Observed value” In cell E2 enter: =COUNTIF(C:C,“&lt;0”) Press enter This formula will count the number of difference scores that are less than zero, or in this case, the number of people who preferred Coke more than Pepsi (16) (also known as the observed value). In the future, you can change the &lt; to a &gt; if you would rather count the number of positive differences. 5.2.6 Calculate the 2-tailed significance in cell D1 enter the label “N” in cell D2 enter the formula: =count(C:C) In cell F1 enter the label “Probability” In cell F2 enter “.5” (Because the chance of someone randomly preferring either Coke or Pepsi is .5 (50/50)) In cell G1 enter the label “sig” (short for significance) in cell G2 enter the formula: =2*MIN(BINOM.DIST(E2,D2,F2,TRUE),1-BINOM.DIST(E2,D2,F2,TRUE)) When you press enter on this final cell, you will have your two-tailed significance. Since our 2-tailed significance (0.0026) is less than our standard alpha (.05), we reject the null hypothesis. 5.2.7 Reporting and Interpreting your result To properly report a sign test, we use the form: s(N)= observed value sig&lt;&gt;alpha or in this case: s(20)=16 sig&lt;.05 To interpret this result, we might say: In our sample of 20 subjects who all provided blind taste test ratings of a Pepsi and a Coke, 16 preferred Coke. This result was found to be reliably different from chance using a sign test analysis, s(20)=16 sig&lt;.05. This result supports the idea that people do prefer Coke to Pepsi, and that our result was not due to sampling error. 5.2.8 Calculating a sign test without difference scores What if you aren’t given a set of paired scores? What if your professor asks you to perform a sign test on a single outcome statement? For example: Test the hypothesis that a coin is weighted if, out of 15 flips of the coin, it lands on tails 13 times. Notice that in this problem, there are no pairs of scores. We’re essentially only given the number of signs: out of 15 flips, the coin landed on tails 13 times (you can think of this as 13 pluses) and on heads obviously twice (you can think of this as 2 minuses). In this case you can simply enter the number of “pluses or minuses” into the “observed value” cell of the excel sheet we create, and update the value of “N”. Excel will then automatically update its calculated significance value 5.2.9 On Your Own In this lab, you will be conducting a sign test to determine whether a coin is weighted. Individually or in small groups, take a coin out of your pocket. If working in groups, use only one coin for the whole group. Now, flip the coin 25 times. Write down how many heads and tails you observed. Enter this into your excel spreadsheet and conduct a two-tailed sign test using an alpha level of .05. What is your result? Have students in the class (or groups) announce their results as well. Did anyone have a trick coin? Do you think some of the coins used were actually weighted? Why or why not? "],

Results of the activity provided below should exactly reproduce the results described in the paper. 6.1.1 STUDY DESCRIPTION Parents often sing to their children and, even as infants, children listen to and look at their parents while they are singing. Research by Mehr, Song, and Spelke (2016) sought to explore the psychological function that music has for parents and infants, by examining the hypothesis that particular melodies convey important social information to infants. Specifically, melodies convey information about social affiliation. The authors argue that melodies are shared within social groups. Whereas children growing up in one culture may be exposed to certain songs as infants (e.g., “Rock-a-bye Baby”), children growing up in other cultures (or even other groups within a culture) may be exposed to different songs.Thus, when a novel person (someone who the infant has never seen before) sings a familiar song, it may signal to the infant that this new person is a member of their social group. To test this hypothesis, the researchers recruited 32 infants and their parents to complete an experiment.During their first visit to the lab, the parents were taught a new lullaby (one that neither they nor their infants had heard before).The experimenters asked the parents to sing the new lullaby to their child every day for the next 1-2 weeks. Following this 1-2 week exposure period, the parents and their infant returned to the lab to complete the experimental portion of the study.Infants were first shown a screen with side-by-side videos of two unfamiliar people, each of whom were silently smiling and looking at the infant.The researchers recorded the looking behavior (or gaze) of the infants during this ‘baseline’ phase. Next, one by one, the two unfamiliar people on the screen sang either the lullaby that the parents learned or a different lullaby (that had the same lyrics and rhythm, but a different melody).Finally, the infants saw the same silent video used at baseline, and the researchers again recorded the looking behavior of the infants during this ‘test’ phase.For more details on the experiment’s methods, please refer to Mehr et al.

Link to .pdf of article Data in .csv format Data in SPSS format 6.4 R 6.4.1 Loading the data The first thing to do is download the .csv formatted data file, using the link above, or just click here. It turns out there are lots of ways to load .csv files into R. Load the data.table library. Then use the fread function and supply the web address to the file. Just like this. No downloading required. library(data.table) all_data &lt;- fread(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrumpLab/statisticsLab/master/data/MehrSongSpelke2016.csv&quot;) Or, if you downloaded the .csv file. Then you can use fread, but you need to point it to the correct file location. The file location in this next example will not work for you, because the file is on my computer. library(data.table) all_data &lt;- fread(&quot;data/MehrSongSpelke2016.csv&quot;) 6.4.2 Inspect the data frame When you have loaded data it’s always a good idea to check out what it looks like. You can look at all of the data in the environment tab on the top right hand corner. The data should be in a variable called all_data. Clicking on all_data will load it into a viewer, and you can scroll around. This can be helpful to see things. But, there is so much data, can be hard to know what you are looking for. 6.4.2.1 summarytools The summarytools packages give a quick way to summarize all of the data in a data frame. Here’s how. When you run this code you will see the summary in the viewer on the bottom right hand side. There’s a little browser button (arrow on top of little window) that you can click to expand and see the whole thing in a browser. library(summarytools) view(dfSummary(all_data)) 6.4.3 Get the data for Experiment one The data contains all of the measurements from all five experiments in the paper. By searching through the all_data data frame, you should look for the variables that code for each experiment. For example, the third column is called exp1, which stands for experiment 1. Notice that it contains a series of 1s. If you keep scrolling down, the 1s stop. These 1s identify the rows associated with the data for Experiment 1. We only want to analyse that data. So, we need to filter our data, and put only those rows into a new variable. We do this with the dplyr library, using the filter function. library(dplyr) experiment_one &lt;- all_data %&gt;% filter(exp1==1) Now if you look at the new variable experiment_one, there are only 32 rows of data. Much less than before. Now we have the data from experiment 1. 6.4.4 Baseline phase: Conduct a one sample t-test You first want to show that infants’ looking behavior did not differ from chance during the baseline trial. The baseline trial was 16 seconds long. During the baseline, infants watched a video of two unfamiliar people, one of the left and one on the right. There was no sound during the baseline. Both of the actors in the video smiled directly at the infant. The important question was to determine whether the infant looked more or less to either person. If they showed no preference, the infant should look at both people about 50% of the time. How could we determine whether the infant looked at both people about 50% of the time? The experiment_one data frame has a column called Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer. All of these values show how the proportion of time that the infant looked to the person who would later sing the familiar song to them. If the average of these proportion is .5 across the infants, then we would have some evidence that the infants were not biased at the beginning of the experiment. However, if the infants on average had a bias toward the singer, then the average proportion of the looking time should be different than .5. Using a one-sample t-test, we can test the hypothesis that our sample mean for the Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer was not different from .5. To do this in R, we just need to isolate the column of data called Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer. We will do this using the $ operator. The $ operator is placed after any data frame variable, and allows you to select a column of the data. The next bit of code will select the column of data we want, and put it into a new variable called Baseline. Note, if you type exp1$ then R-Studio should automatically bring up all the columns you can choose from. baseline &lt;- experiment_one$Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer 6.4.4.1 Look at the numbers Question: Why is it important to look at your numbers? What could happen if you didn’t? OK, we could just do the t-test right away, it’s really easy, only one line of code. But, we haven’t even looked at the numbers yet. Let’s at least do that. First, we’ll just use plot. It will show every data point for each infant as a dot. plot(baseline) That’s helpful, we see that the dots are all over the place. Let’s do a histogram, so we can get a better sense of the frequency of different proportions. hist(baseline) 6.4.4.2 Look at the descriptives Let’s get the mean and standard deviation of the sample mean(baseline) ## [1] 0.5210967 sd(baseline) ## [1] 0.1769651 OK, so just looking at the mean, we see the proportion is close to .5 (it’s .521). And, we see there is a healthy amount of variance (the dots were all over the place), as the standard deviation was about .176. Question: Based on the means and standard deviations can you make an educated guess about what the t and p values might be? Learn how to do this and you will be improving your data-sense. Now, before we run the t-test, what do you think is going to happen? We are going to get a t-value, and an associated p-value. If you can make a guess at what those numbers would be right now in your head, and those end up being pretty close to the ones we will see in a moment, then you should pat yourself on the back. You have learned how to have intuitions about the data. As I am writing this I will tell you that 1) I can’t remember what the t and p was from the paper, and I haven’t done the test yet, so I don’t know the answer. So, I am allowed to guess what the answer will be. Here are my guesses t(31) = 0.2, p = .95. The numbers in the brackets are degrees of freedom, which we know are 31 (df= n-1 = 32-1= 31). More important than the specific numbers I am guessing (which will probably be wrong), I am guessing that the p-value will be pretty large, it will not be less than .05, which the author’s set as their alpha rate. So, I am guessing we will not reject the hypothesis that .52 is different from .5. Let’s do the t-test and see what happens. 6.4.4.3 Conduct t.test t.test(baseline, mu=.5) ## ## One Sample t-test ## ## data: baseline ## t = 0.67438, df = 31, p-value = 0.5051 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0.5 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4572940 0.5848994 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x ## 0.5210967 Question: Why was the baseline condition important for the experiment? What does performance in this condition tell us? So, there we have it. We did a one-sample t-test. Here’s how you would report it, t(31) = .67, p = .505. Or, we might say something like: During the baseline condition, the mean proportion looking time toward the singer was .52, and was not significantly different from .5, according to a one-sample test, t(31) = .67, p = .505. You should take the time to check this result, and see if it is the same one that was reported in the paper. 6.4.5 Test phase Remember how the experiment went. Infants watched silent video recordings of two women (Baseline). Then each person sung a song, one was familiar to the infant (their parents sung the song to them many times), and one was unfamiliar (singing phase). After the singing phase, the infants watched the silent video of the two singers again (test phase). The critical question was whether the infants would look more to the person who sung the familiar song compared to the person who sun the unfamiliar song. If the infants did this, they should look more than 50% of the time to the singer who sang the familiar song. We have the data, we can do another one sample t-test to find out. We can re-use all the code we already wrote to do this. I’ll put it all in one place. If we run all of this code, we will see all of the things we want to see. We only need to make two changes. We will change experiment_one$Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer to experiment_one$Test_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer, because that column has the test phase data. And, instead of putting the data into the variable baseline. We will make a new variable called test_phase to store the data. test_phase &lt;- experiment_one$Test_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer plot(test_phase) hist(test_phase) mean(test_phase) ## [1] 0.5934913 sd(test_phase) ## [1] 0.1786884 t.test(test_phase, mu = .5) ## ## One Sample t-test ## ## data: test_phase ## t = 2.9597, df = 31, p-value = 0.005856 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0.5 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.5290672 0.6579153 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x ## 0.5934913 Question: Why was the test condition important for the experiment? What does performance in this condition tell us? Alright. What did we find? You should take a stab at writing down what we found. You can use the same kind of language that I used from the first one sample-test. You should state the mean proportion, the t-value, the dfs, and the p-value. You should be able to answer the question, did the infants look longer at the singer who sang the familiar song? And, did they look longer than would be consist with chance at 50%. 6.4.6 Paired-samples t-test The paired samples t-test is easy to do. We’ve already made two variables called baseline, and test_phase. These contain each of the infants looking time proportions to the singer for both parts of the experiment. We can see if the difference between them was likely or unlikely due to chance by running a paired samples t-test. We do it like this in one line: t.test(test_phase, baseline, paired=TRUE, var.equal=TRUE) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: test_phase and baseline ## t = 2.4164, df = 31, p-value = 0.02175 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.01129217 0.13349698 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## 0.07239458 Question: Why was the paired samples t-test necessary if we already did two one sample t-test? What new question is the paired samples t-test asking? I’ll leave it to you to interpret these values, and to see if they are the same as the ones in the paper. Based on these values what do you conclude? Is there a difference between the mean proportion looking times for the baseline and testing phase? 6.4.6.1 Relationship between one-sample and paired sample t-test Question: Why is it that a paired samples t-test can be the same as the one sample t-test? What do you have to do the data in the paired samples t-test in order to conduct a one-sample t-test that would give you the same result? We’ve discussed in the textbook that the one-sample and paired sample t-test are related, they can be the same test. The one-sample test whether a sample mean is different from some particular mean. The paired sample t-test, is to determine whether one sample mean is different from another sample mean. If you take the scores for each variable in a paired samples t-test, and subtract them from one another, then you have one list of difference scores. Then, you could use a one sample t-test to test whether these difference scores are different from 0. It turns out you get the same answer from a paired sample t-test testing the difference between two sample means, and the one sample t-test testing whether the mean difference of the difference scores between the samples are different from 0. We can show this in r easily like this: t.test(test_phase, baseline, paired=TRUE, var.equal=TRUE) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: test_phase and baseline ## t = 2.4164, df = 31, p-value = 0.02175 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.01129217 0.13349698 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## 0.07239458 difference_scores&lt;-test_phase-baseline t.test(difference_scores, mu=0) ## ## One Sample t-test ## ## data: difference_scores ## t = 2.4164, df = 31, p-value = 0.02175 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.01129217 0.13349698 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x ## 0.07239458 6.4.6.2 Usefulness of difference scores OK fine, the paired samples t-test can be a one sample t-test if you use the difference scores. This might just seem like a mildly useful factoid you can use for stats trivia games (which no one plays). The point of drawing your attention to the relationship, is to get you to focus on the difference scores. These are what we are actually interested in. Let’s use the difference scores to one more useful thing. Sometime the results of a t-test aren’t intuitively obvious. By the t-test we found out that a small difference between the test phase and baseline was not likely produced by chance. How does this relate to the research question about infants using familiar songs as cues for being social? Let’s ask a very simple question. How many infants actually showed the bias? How many infants out of 32 looked longer at the singer who sang the familiar song during test, compared to during baseline. We can determine this by calculating the difference scores. Then, asking how many of them were greater than zero: difference_scores &lt;- test_phase-baseline length(difference_scores[difference_scores&gt;0]) ## [1] 22 So, 22 out of 32 infants showed the effect. To put that in terms of probability, 68.75% of infants showed the effect. These odds and percentages give us another way to appreciate how strong the effect is. It wasn’t strong enough for all infants to show it. 6.4.7 Graphing the findings It is often useful to graph the results of our analysis. We have already looked at dot plots and histograms of the individual samples. But, we also conducted some t-tests on the means of the baseline and test_phase samples. One of the major questions was whether these means are different. Now, we will make a graph that shows the means for each condition. Actually, we will make a few different graphs, so that you can think about what kinds of graphs are most helpful. There are two major important things to show: 1) the sample means, and 2) a visual aid for statistical inference showing whether the results were likely due to chance. We will use the ggplot2 package to make our graphs. Remember, there are two steps to take when using ggplot2. 1) put your data in a long form data frame, where each measure has one row, and 2) define the layers of the ggplot. 6.4.7.1 Make the dataframe for plotting To start we will need 2 columns. One column will code the experimental phase, Baseline or Test. There are 32 observations in each phase, so we want the word Baseline to appear 32 times, followed by the word Test 32 times. Then we want a single column with each of the proportions for each infant. Phase &lt;- rep(c(&quot;Baseline&quot;,&quot;Test&quot;), each = 32) Proportions &lt;- c(baseline,test_phase) plot_df &lt;- data.frame(Phase,Proportions) 6.4.7.2 Dot plot of raw scores This shows every scores value on the y-axis, split by the baseline and test groups. If you just looked at this, you might not think the test phase was different from the baseline phase. Still very useful to see the spread of individual scores. Supports the intuition that the scores are still kind of in a similar ballpark. library(ggplot2) ggplot(plot_df, aes(x=Phase, y=Proportions))+ geom_point() 6.4.7.3 Dot plot with means and raw scores Question: What kinds of inferences about the role of chance in producing the difference between the means can we make from this graph? What is missing? ggplot2 is great because it let’s us add different layers on top of an existing plot. It would be good to see where the mean values for each sample lie on top of the sample scores. We can do this. But, to do it, we need to supply ggplot with another data frame, one that contains the means for each phase in long form. There are are only two phases, and two means, so we will make a rather small data.frame. It will have two columns, a Phase column, and Mean_value column. There will only be two rows in the data frame, one for the mean for each phase. To make the smaller data frame for the means we will use the aggregate function. This allows us to find the means for each phase from the plot_df data frame. It also automatically returns the data frame we are looking for. mean_df &lt;- aggregate(Proportions ~ Phase, plot_df, mean) ggplot(plot_df, aes(x=Phase, y=Proportions))+ geom_point()+ geom_point(data=mean_df, color=&quot;Red&quot;, size=2) 6.4.7.4 Bar plot It’s very common to use bars in graphs. We can easily do this by using geom_bar, rather than geom_point. Also, we can plot bars for the means, and keep showing the dots like this…(note this will be messed up, but I want to show you why). Also look for these changes. added stat=&quot;identity&quot; Necessary for bar plot to show specific numbers added aes(fill=Phase) Makes each bar a different color, depending on which phase it comes from ggplot(plot_df, aes(x=Phase, y=Proportions))+ geom_point()+ geom_bar(data=mean_df, stat=&quot;identity&quot;,aes(fill=Phase)) OK, we see the bars and some of the dots, but not all of them. What is going on? Remember, ggplot2 works in layers. Whatever layer you add first will be printed first in the graph, whatever layer you add second will be printed on top of the first. We put the bars on top of the dots. Let’s change the order of the layers so the dot’s go on top of the bars. ggplot(plot_df, aes(x=Phase, y=Proportions))+ geom_bar(data=mean_df, stat=&quot;identity&quot;,aes(fill=Phase))+ geom_point() 6.4.7.5 Bar plot with error bars So far we have only plotted the means and individual sample scores. These are useful, but neither of them give us clear visual information about our statistical test. Our paired sample t-test suggested that the mean difference between Baseline and Test was not very likely by chance. It could have happened, but wouldn’t happen very often. Question: Why would the standard deviation of each mean, or the standard error of each mean be inappropriate to use in this case? Question: How would error bars based on the standard error of the mean differences aid in visual inference about the role of chance in producing the difference? Error bars are commonly used as an aid for visual inference. The use of error bars can be a subtle nuanced issue. This is because there a different kinds of error bars that can be plotted, and each one supports different kinds of inference. In general, the error bar is supposed to represent some aspect of the variability associated with each mean. We could plot little bars that are +1 or -1 standard deviations of each mean, or we would do +1 or -1 standard errors of each mean. In the case of paired samples, neither or these error bars would be appropriate, they wouldn’t reflect the variability associated with mean we are interested in. In a paired samples t-test, we are interested in the variability of the mean of the difference scores. Let’s calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM) for the difference scores between Baseline and Test, and then add error bars to the plot. difference_scores &lt;- baseline-test_phase #calculate difference scores standard_error &lt;- sd(difference_scores)/sqrt(length(difference_scores)) #calculate SEM ggplot(plot_df, aes(x=Phase, y=Proportions))+ geom_bar(data=mean_df, stat=&quot;identity&quot;,aes(fill=Phase))+ geom_errorbar(data=mean_df, aes(ymin=Proportions-standard_error, ymax=Proportions+standard_error), width=.1) + geom_point(alpha=.25) Question: What is one reason why these error bars (standard error of the mean difference between Baseline and Test) are appropriate to use. What is one reason they are not appropriate to use? We have done something that is useful for visual inference. From the textbook, we learned that differences of about 2 standard errors of the mean are near the point where we would claim that chance is unlikely to have produced the difference. This is a rough estimate. But, we can see that the top of the error bar for Baseline is lower than the bottom of the error bar for Test, resulting in a difference greater than 2 standard error bars. So, based on this graph, we might expect the difference between conditions to be significant. We can also complain about what we have done here, we are placing the same error bars from the mean difference scores onto the means for each condition. In some sense this is misleading. The error bars are not for the depicted sample means, they are for the hidden single set of difference scores. To make this more clear, we will make a bar plot with a single bar only for the differences scores. difference_scores &lt;- test_phase-baseline #calculate difference scores standard_error &lt;- sd(difference_scores)/sqrt(length(difference_scores)) #calculate SEM mean_difference &lt;- mean(difference_scores) qplot(x=&quot;MeanDifference&quot;, y=mean_difference)+ geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, width=.5, alpha=.5)+ geom_hline(yintercept=0)+ geom_point(aes(y=difference_scores), alpha=.25)+ geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean_difference-standard_error, ymax=mean_difference+standard_error), width=.1) Question: Why is is it more appropriate to put the standard error of the difference on this bar graph? What important aspects of the original results shown in the previous graph are missing from this graph? This plot is very useful too, it gives us some new information. We can see that the mean difference (test - baseline) was greater than 0. And, we are plotting the standard error of the mean differences, which are the error bars that more formally belong to this graph. Still, we are in a position to make some guesses for visual inference. The lower error bar represents only 1 SEM. It does not cross 0, but the fact that 1 SEM does not cross zero isn’t important. For SEMs it’s usually closer to 2. We can sort of visually guesstimate that that 2 SEMs would not cross zero, which would suggest we would obtain a small p-value. We also see each of the mean difference scores. It’s very clear that they are all over the place. This means that not every infant showed a looking time preference toward the singer of the familiar song. Finally, this single bar plot misses something. It doesn’t tell us what the values of the original means were. 6.4.7.6 Bar plot with confidence intervals Confidence intervals are also often used for error bars, rather than the standard error (or other measure of variance). If we use 95% confidence intervals, then our error bars can be even more helpful for visual inference. Running the t.test function produces confidence interval estimates, and we can pull them out and use them for error bars. t_test_results &lt;- t.test(difference_scores) lower_interval&lt;- t_test_results$conf.int[1] upper_interval&lt;- t_test_results$conf.int[2] qplot(x=&quot;MeanDifference&quot;, y=mean_difference)+ geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, width=.5, alpha=.5)+ geom_hline(yintercept=0)+ geom_point(aes(y=difference_scores), alpha=.25)+ geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=lower_interval, ymax=upper_interval), width=.1) Notice that the 95% confidence intervals around the mean are wider than the SEM error bars from the previous graph. These new confidence intervals tell us that 95% of the time our sample mean will fall between the two lines. The bottom line is slightly above 0, so we can now visually see support for our statistical inference that chance was unlikely to produce the result. If chance was likely to produce the result, the horizontal line indicating 0, would be well inside the confidence interval. We can also notice that the mean difference was just barely different from chance, that lower bar is almost touching 0. 6.4.8 Data-simulation We can do a little bit of data simulation to get a better feel for this kind of data. For example, we saw that the dots in our plots were quite variable. We might wonder about what chance can do in the current experiment. One way to do this is to estimate the standard deviation of the looking time proportions. Perhaps the best way to do that would be to an average of the standard deviation in the baseline and test_phase conditions. Then, we could simulate 32 scores from a normal distribution with mean = .5, and standard deviation equaling our mean standard deviation. We could calculate the mean of our simulated sample. And, we could do this many times, say 1000 times. Then, we could look at a histogram of our means. This will show the range of sample means we would expect just by chance. This is another way to tell whether the observed difference in this experiment in the testing phase was close or not close from being produced by chance. Take a look at the histogram. What do you think? sample_sd &lt;- (sd(baseline)+sd(test_phase))/2 simulated_means &lt;- length(1000) for(i in 1:1000){ simulated_means[i] &lt;- mean(rnorm(32,.5, sample_sd)) } hist(simulated_means) #### Simulating the mean differences We can do the simulation slightly differently to give us a different look at chance. Above we simulated the sample means from a normal distribution centered on .5. The experimental question of interest was whether the mean difference between the baseline and test_phase condition was different. So, we should do a simulation of the difference scores. First, we estimate the standard deviation of the difference scores, and then run the simulation with a normal distribution centered on 0 (an expected mean difference of 0). This shows roughly how often we might expect mean differences of various sizes to occur. One major limitation is that we likely had only a rough estimate of the true standard deviation of these mean differences, after all there were only 32 of them, so we should take this with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, the pattern in the simulation fits well with the observations in that we already made from the data. sample_sd &lt;- sd(baseline-test_phase) simulated_mean_difference &lt;- length(1000) for(i in 1:1000){ simulated_mean_difference[i] &lt;- mean(rnorm(32,0, sample_sd)) } hist(simulated_mean_difference) 6.4.9 Generalization Exercise ( 1 point - Pass/Fail ) The following code creates a data frame with simulated means for each of 20 subjects in two conditions (A and B) Condition_A &lt;- rnorm(20,100,25) Condition_B &lt;- rnorm(20,100,25) Subjects &lt;- rep(1:20,2) sim_df &lt;- data.frame(Subjects, Condition_A, Condition_B) Conduct a paired samples t-test on the sim_df dataframe. Report the results of the t-test, and the mean difference between conditions The above code assumes no difference in the means between Condition A and Condition B. Both samples come from the same normal distribution. Change the mean for one of the distributions. Make the change large enough so that you find a significant p-value (p &lt; 0.05) when you conduct the t-test on the new simulated data.

To test their hypothesis, the researchers recruited 32 infants and their parents to complete an experiment. During their first visit to the lab, the parents were taught a new lullaby (one that neither they nor their infants had heard before).The experimenters asked the parents to sing the new lullaby to their child every day for the next 1-2 weeks. Following this exposure period, the parents and their infant returned to the lab to complete the experimental portion of the study. Infants were first shown a screen with side-by-side videos of two unfamiliar people, each of whom were silently smiling and looking at the infant. The researchers recorded the looking behavior (or gaze) of the infants during this ‘baseline’ phase. Next, one by one, the two unfamiliar people on the screen sang either the lullaby that the parents learned or a different lullaby (that had the same lyrics and rhythm, but a different melody). Finally, the infants saw the same silent video used at baseline, and the researchers again recorded the looking behavior of the infants during this ‘test’ phase. 6.6.2 Performing a one-sample t-test First, let’s open the relevant data file; Here is the link. It’s called “MehrSongSpelke2016_Experiment1.sav” Open this file in SPSS. Your data should look like this: We will use SPSS to determine whether the infants looked equally at each of the people in the side-by-side videos at baseline. Let’s think about why this is important. The infants in this experiment watched silent video recordings of two women (Baseline). Later, each person sungs a song, one familiar (their parents sung the song to them many times), and one unfamiliar. Afterwards, the infants watched the silent video of the two singers again (test phase). The critical question was whether the infants would look more to the person who sung the familiar song compared to the person who sung the unfamiliar song. If the measure of what infants “like” or “prefer” is based on how long they look at a stimulus (in this case, a person in a video), we need to know that at baseline (before either of the people were associated with a song), infants looked equally at each person. If one of the people in the video was more memorable or attractive to the infants, then they would have a preferential bias towards looking at one person over the other. This could mean that the results of the study may have nothing to do with the songs, but rather an inherent bias towards the appearance of one of the people. This is why it is important to ensure that the infants looked at the people equally to start with (at baseline). In our data file, the variable we will use is called “Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer”; this variable represents the proportion of time (out of 100%) that the infant spent looking at the person who would later be the singer of the familiar song. If the infant looks equally at each person, then the proportion of time spent looking at one out of the two people should be .5, or half of the time. Thus, we want to test whether the proportions measured are different from .5. Whenever we want to compare a sample data set (the proportions measured for all 32 infants) to a known mean (.5, or the proportion we expect if infants looked equally at both people), we use a one-sample t-test. Before we begin, it’s important to notice that our data file has 96 rows in it, for 96 infants. However, Experiment 1 only used 32 infants. If you find the column labeled exp1, it will show you which infants belong to that experiment. You’ll notice there are a series of 1s (32 of them, to be exact) signifying the infants in Experiment 1. We will have to split our data file so we can run subsequent analyses only on this Experiment 1 data. Go to Data, then Split file… A window will appear. Choose Organize output by groups and enter the exp1 variable in the “Groups Based on” field: Click OK. SPSS will generate an output window to confirm you have split your file. In order to run the t-test, go to the Analyze menu, then choose Compare Means and then One-Sample T-test: This will open up a window in which you will specify which variable contains the relevant sample data. Remember, we are interested in the variable labeled Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer, so let’s choose this variable from the list on the left and move it to the right-hand field using the arrow. Next, make sure to change the value in the field labeled “Test Value” to the mean to which you are comparing the sample. Since we are comparing our sample’s proportions to the proportion that represents equal time spent looking at both people in the video, we are going to use .5 as our test value. Enter this number in the appropriate field. Your window should look like this: Now, click OK. SPSS will produce several output tables; some for exp1 = 0 (these are the infants not included in experiment 1) and for exp = 1 (for the infants included in experiment 1–this is the one we want!), as follows: The first table contains descriptive statistics related to the sample. We can see from this table that the average proportion of time spent looking at the person who would later be the familiar song singer is .521. This is very close to .50. The second table contains the information resulting from our t-test: The t-statistic calculated is .674, with 31 (N-1) degrees of freedom. The p-value is listed under “Sig.”. The fact that this value is not less than our alpha level (set at .05) means we fail to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, the proportion of time infants spent looking at the singer was not different from .50. We might formally words this as follows: During the baseline condition, the mean proportion looking time toward the singer was .52, and was not significantly different from .5, according to a one-sample test, t(31) = .67, p = .505. 6.6.3 Performing a paired-samples t-test In this example, we will be comparing data from two samples taken from the same individuals. In the same data file as above, we have two variables named Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer and Test_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer. These variables represent the proportion of time spent looking at the familiar song singer at baseline, and then again in the test phase (after the 1-2 week period in which infants have been familiarized with the song). Because each infant was measured once (baseline), and then re-measured again (test), we will use a paired-samples t-test. Let’s continue with the split file we used in the previous example. In order to run the paired-samples t-test, go to Analyze, then Compare Means, then Paired-Samples T-test... A window will appear with a list of all variables in a field on the left. We must choose the two variables that contain our data: Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer and Test_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer. Move these into the right-hand field individually using the arrow. Make sure that they appear next to each other in the right-hand field, as follows: Click OK, and SPSS will produce several output tables. Remember, we’re only choosing the tables for exp1 = 1 (this includes only the 32 infants in experiment 1). The tables are as follows: The paired-samples t-test produces a t-value, degrees of freedom (N-1), and a p-value. You can interpret these values the same way as in the previous example. During the baseline condition, The difference between Infants’ mean proportion looking time toward the singer at baseline and the test phase was -.072, and was significant according to a paired-samples t-test, t(31) = -2.416, p &lt; .05. 6.6.4 Graphing your results In order to visualize the difference between means (for a paired-samples t-test, in this case), it is most appropriate to create a bar chart, or bar plot. Because our two conditions (baseline and test) are categorical, discrete (and not continuous) variables, this type of chart is most appropriate. Let’s begin by going to Graphs, then Chart Builder… The Chart Builder window will open and look like this: We are going to choose a simple bar chart, which is represented by the bar icon at the top left of the set of chart options. Click on this icon and drag it into the chart window as follows: Once you do this, your window should look like this: From here, you must indicate which variables should be included in the chart on the y-axis. We will first take the Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer variable, found in the list on the left of the window, and drag it to the y-axis in the chart window. You will see that the y-axis area will highlight with a red border when you do this. Now, take the next variable, Test_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer, and drag it over the same y-axis title, but this time aim for the very top of the variable field. You will know you’re doing it right when a red plus sign appears in this area as you hover: Drop this variable into this field once you see the plus sign. A window will pop us asking if you want both variables on this axis. Click OK. The result will look like this (both variables’ means, baseline and test, appear in the chart). From here, you can customize the appearance of the graph. One thing we will do is add Error Bars. Find the window to the right of the main chart builder window, and select Error Bars. You will have the option to select Confidence Intervals, Standard Error, etc. Choose Standard Error and set the Multiplier to 2. Click Apply. Now, you should be able to see the bars in the chart builder window. If you are satisfied with the chart, click OK and it will appear in an SPSS output window: 6.6.5 The relationship between the one-sample and the paired-samples t-test This section is dedicated to demonstrating that the one-sample and paired-samples t-tests are almost the very same thing. In order to understand this, we must reframe how we think about the paired-samples t-test. We typically consider it a comparison between two samples in which observations have been repeated (like in a before-after scenario, for example). We can also think of the paired-samples t-test as testing the DIFFERENCE scores between two conditions. If the difference between two conditions is 0, then there is no difference, or there is no effect of the independent variable. If the difference is non-zero, then we can say there IS a difference. Thus, the paired-samples t-test is exactly the same as the one-sample t-test if we consider it as a comparison of the mean DIFFERENCE score to 0. Let’s demonstrate this using SPSS. We’ll continue using the same data as above. Specifically, locate the variable named Difference_in_Proportion_Looking. This variable contains the difference score between the baseline and test conditions for each infant. We’re going to treat this as our one sample (as in the one-sample t-test), and we’ll be comparing it to a mean of 0. Remember also that our file is still split so we can do analyses on only those individuals in experiment 1. Let’s begin. Go to Analyze, then Compare Means, then One-Sample t-test… A window will appear. Move the variable of interest, Difference_in_Proportion_Looking, into the “Test Variable(s)” field. Below that, make sure to enter 0 in the “Test Value” field. Then click OK. SPSS will generate several tables in the output window. Make sure to find the tables associated with exp1 = 1. They should look like this: You will see that the t-statistic and p-value are identical to the ones obtained when we conducted a paired-samples t-test. Therefore, a paired-samples t-test conducted on two samples is equivalent to a one-sample t-test conducted on the difference scores (calculated on the two samples) compared against 0. Nota Bene: You will see that in the previous paired-samples t-test we obtained a t-statistic of -2.416, but here the t-statistic is positive. This difference comes from the fact that SPSS automatically subtracts the later-occuring variable in your spreadsheet from the earlier-occuring one. If your variables were ordered differently, you would obtain a positive t-statistic as well. In other words, the sign does not matter; it results from the order of the variables. 6.6.6 Practice Problems Use the data file from this lab tutorial to test whether the number of frames the baby spent gazing at the familiar song is significantly different than the number of frames spent gazing at the unfamiliar song (use alpha = .05). Report your results in proper statistical reporting format. Graph this result (including 1 SEM error bars) as a bar graph. Compute a new variable representing the difference in number of frames the baby spent gazing between the familiar and unfamiliar song conditions. Test this difference score against a mean of 0 (use alpha=.05). Report your results in proper statistical reporting format. 6.7 JAMOVI How to do it in JAMOVI "],

Would you be more likely to get the job after giving a short speech describing your skills, or after writing a short speech and having a potential employer read those words? That was the question raised by Schroeder and Epley (2015).The authors predicted that a person’s speech (i.e., vocal tone, cadence, and pitch) communicates information about their intellect better than their written words (even if they are the same words as in the speech). To examine this possibility, the authors randomly assigned 39 professional recruiters for Fortune 500 companies to one of two conditions. In the audio condition, participants listened to audio recordings of a job candidate’s spoken job pitch. In the transcript condition, participants read a transcription of the job candidate’s pitch. After hearing or reading the pitch, the participants rated the job candidates on three dimensions: intelligence, competence, and thoughtfulness. These ratings were then averaged to create a single measure of the job candidate’s intellect, with higher scores indicating the recruiters rated the candidates as higher in intellect. The participants also rated their overall impression of the job candidate (a composite of two items measuring positive and negative impressions). Finally, the participants indicated how likely they would be to recommend hiring the job candidate (0 - not at all likely, 10 - extremely likely). What happened? Did the recruiters think job applicants were smarter when they read the transcripts, or when the heard the applicants speak? We have the data, we can find out. 7.2 Lab skills learned Conduct independent samples t-tests Generate figures Discuss the results and implications 7.3 Important Stuff citation: Schroeder, J., &amp; Epley, N.

The authors ran lots of experiments, but we only have the data from Experiment 4. This is great, we don’t need to subset the data frame to find all of the data that we need. But, we do still need to understand what data we want to analyze. Let’s start with identify the column that codes the experimental conditions for whether or not the evaluator read a transcript or heard the interview. 7.4.3.1 Condition variable Lucky for us, the condition variable is called CONDITION! Let’s take a look. We printed it out just by writing down all_data$CONDITION. There 0s and 1s for each condition (audio vs. transcript). But which one is which? This isn’t clear from the data, and it isn’t clear from the paper, or from the repository. We have to do some guess work. I went ahead and computed the means for the Intellect_rating between each condition, and then compared those to the graph in the paper for E4. It looks like 1 = audio condition, and 0 = transcript condition. all_data$CONDITION ## [1] 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 ## [36] 1 0 1 1 aggregate(Intellect_Rating~CONDITION,all_data,mean) ## CONDITION Intellect_Rating ## 1 0 3.648148 ## 2 1 5.634921 Let’s use words instead of 0s and 1s to refer to our experimental conditions. To do this, we will chance the values of 0 and 1, to the words transcript and audio. We can do this in two steps. First we convert the CONDITION column to a factor. This will automatically turn the 0s and 1s into strings (not numbers, text). Factors have an internal variable for the names of the levels, which will be 0 and 1. We can simply change the level names to transcript and audio. all_data$CONDITION &lt;- as.factor(all_data$CONDITION) levels(all_data$CONDITION) &lt;- c(&quot;transcript&quot;,&quot;audio&quot;) Now if you look at the all_data variable, you will see the words transcript and audio, where 0s and 1s used to be. 7.4.3.2 Dependent Measures Next it’s time to find the dependent measure columns. The graph from the paper shows three different measures in each condition. These included Intellect, General Impression, and Hiring Likelihood. Every evaluator (either given a transcript or audio recording of the interview) gave ratings on a scale of 1 to 10 for each of those concepts. It’s not immediately clear which columns in all_data correspond to those three measures. There are lots of different measures that could be the ones they reported. It turns out the relevant ones are called Intellect_Rating Impression_Rating Hire_Rating In this tutorial we are going to walk through doing an independent samples t-test for the first measure, Intellect_Rating. You can follow these same steps to complete the same kind of t-test for the other two variables. 7.4.4 Look at the dependent variable. Question: Why do we always want to look at the data? What is the first thing we do before even considering an inferential test? Look at the data. Always look at the data. We could make a dot plot or histogram of the data from the Intellect_ratings. But, from our last lab we already learned how to make graphs showing most of the information we would want to look at. For example, we could make a bar graph that has the means for each condition (transcript vs. audio), standard errors of the mean and the actual scores as little dots. This would be great to look at it. Not only will it tell us if there are really weird numbers in the data (who knows maybe the data file is corrupted, you need to look), it will also give us strong intuitions about what to expect for the t-test. We can plot each score as a dot using the all_data data frame. If we want to add on a layer for the sample means, and for the sample standard errors, we have to compute those and put them in a new data frame first. Then we use both data frames with ggplot to plot all of the information. We will use dplyr to quickly get the means and the standard errors and put them in a new data frame called decriptive_df. library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) # get means and SEs descriptive_df &lt;- all_data %&gt;% group_by(CONDITION) %&gt;% summarise(means= mean(Intellect_Rating), SEs = sd(Intellect_Rating)/sqrt(length(Intellect_Rating))) # Make the plot ggplot(descriptive_df, aes(x=CONDITION, y=means))+ geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, aes(fill=CONDITION))+ # add means geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=means-SEs, # add error bars ymax=means+SEs), width=.1) + geom_point(data=all_data, aes(x=CONDITION, y=Intellect_Rating), alpha=.5)+ geom_point(alpha=.25)+ ylab(&quot;Rating&quot;) This plot is very useful. First, we can see the numbers in our dependent measure are behaving sensibly. We know that the numbers have to be between 1-10, because those were the only options in the scale. If we found numbers bigger or smaller, we would know something was wrong. Checking for things that are obviously wrong in the data is one reason why we always look at first. We are checking for obvious errors. There are other ways to check to, but looking is fast and easy. Question: Why are the standard errors of each sample an appropriate thing to use for error bars? Now that you can see the patterns in the data, you should form an intuition about how the independent samples t-test will turn out. You can see how big the error bars (+1/-1 standard error of each sample man). The t-test will tell us whether the observed difference (or greater) is likely due to chance. Should we find a big t-value or a small t-value? Should we find a big p-value or a small t-value. If you understand how t-values and p-values work, the answer should be very clear from the graph. You should already know how the t-test will turn out before you run it. Running it will confirm what you already suspect to be true. 7.4.5 Conduct Independent samples t-test Question: Why are we conducting an independent samples t-test, and not a one-sample or paired samples t-test? We use the very same t.test function that we used last time to conduct a t-test. The only difference is that we don’t tell the R to use a paired sample t-test. We leave the paired=TRUE statement out, and R automatically knows we want to do an independent samples t-test. Remember to set the var.equal=TRUE, otherwise R will compute a different version of the t-test. You can use different syntax to run the t-test. Because our data is already in a data frame we can use this syntax. t.test(Intellect_Rating~CONDITION, data=all_data, var.equal=TRUE) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: Intellect_Rating by CONDITION ## t = -3.5259, df = 37, p-value = 0.001144 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -3.1284798 -0.8450652 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group transcript mean in group audio ## 3.648148 5.634921 The t.test function also will work on two variables, not in a data frame. For example, the following does the same thing. But, it’s harder to read, and the means are described in terms of X and Y, not terms of transcript and audio, like the report above. t.test(all_data[all_data$CONDITION==&#39;transcript&#39;,]$Intellect_Rating, all_data[all_data$CONDITION==&#39;audio&#39;,]$Intellect_Rating, var.equal=T) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: all_data[all_data$CONDITION == &quot;transcript&quot;, ]$Intellect_Rating and all_data[all_data$CONDITION == &quot;audio&quot;, ]$Intellect_Rating ## t = -3.5259, df = 37, p-value = 0.001144 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -3.1284798 -0.8450652 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 3.648148 5.634921 Question: What conclusions do we draw from the t-test? Based on these results, if you were being evaluated for a job interview, would you rather have the evaluator read a transcript of your interview or listen to an audio recording? So, now we have the t-test. It shows the t-value, the p-value, and the means for each group. You can double-check with the paper to see if we found the same results as reported by the authors. 7.4.6 Remaining ratings Now, you should use what you have learned to analyse the last two ratings for the dependent variables Impression_Rating, and Hire_Rating. This is your task for the generalization exercise. Remember to plot the data for each, and conduct a t-test for each. Then compare what you found to the original article. What did you find, and what do the results mean? 7.4.7 Reconstructing the graph from the paper The results from Experiment 4 in the paper plot the means and error bars (+1 / -1 SEM) for all three dependent measures, for both experimental conditions. We can do this in ggplot using the data. We will have to make a couple changes to the data frame. But, it won’t be too hard. What we need to do is make a fully long form data frame. Remember a long form data frame has one row per dependent measure. The all_data frame is partly long and partly wide. If we are only interested in one dependent measure, then it is a long data frame for that measure. For example, example if we are only interested in plotting Intellect_Rating, then we already have one observation of that dependent measure for each row. But, in the other columns, the dependent measures for Impression_Rating and Hire_Rating are in the same rows. Before continuing, it is very much worth mentioning that this part of data analysis happens a lot, and it is kind of annoying. I call it the rubix cube problem, because we need to “rotate” and transform the format of the data to accomplish different kinds of analysis goals. It’s good to be able to know how to do this. This problem occurs all of the time, and can occur for any software package. It’s a good thing you are learning R, because we can do these things easily in R. They are not often so easy to do without a computer programming language like R. The worst thing to do is transform the data by hand. That really sucks. Believe me you don’t want to do it. Why? Because you will make mistakes, and you will mess up the data, then you will mess up your analysis. And, you won’t be able to find your mistakes, and it will take you ages to correct them. That sucks. There’s more than one way to transform data in R. For example the cast and melt functions do this kind of thing. You can look those up. In this example we will not use those functions. Instead we will show some steps to build the required data frame one step at a time. # repeat CONDITION column three times condition &lt;- rep(all_data$CONDITION,3) # make a ratings variable with all three ratings in one variable ratings &lt;- c(all_data$Intellect_Rating, all_data$Impression_Rating, all_data$Hire_Rating) # make a new factor variable with the names of the ratings # need to repeat each level name the appropriate number of times num_to_repeat &lt;- length(all_data$CONDITION) rating_type &lt;- rep(c(&quot;Intellect&quot;,&quot;Impression&quot;,&quot;Hire&quot;),num_to_repeat) # put the new variables into a data frame plot_all &lt;- data.frame(condition,rating_type,ratings) # Get the means and standard errors for each rating by condition descriptive_all &lt;- plot_all %&gt;% group_by(condition,rating_type) %&gt;% summarise(means= mean(ratings), SEs = sd(ratings)/sqrt(length(ratings))) # Make the plot ggplot(descriptive_all, aes(x=rating_type, y=means, group=condition))+ geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, aes(fill=condition), position=&#39;dodge&#39;)+ geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=means-SEs, ymax=means+SEs), width=.1, position = position_dodge(width=.9)) + geom_point(data=plot_all, aes(x=rating_type, y=ratings, group=condition), alpha=.25, position = position_dodge(width=.9))+ geom_point(alpha=.25)+ ylab(&quot;Rating&quot;) Well, we didn’t make the exact graph. We have the bars, the error bars, and we added the individual scores because they are useful to look at. Otherwise, it’s the same graph (except the the ordering of bars is determined alphabetically here. We change that in ggplot, but we won’t do that today.) 7.4.8 Generalization Exercise (1 point - Pass/Fail) Complete the generalization exercise described in your R Markdown document for this lab.

To conduct this study, the authors randomly assigned 39 professional recruiters for Fortune 500 companies to one of two conditions. In the audio condition, participants listened to audio recordings of a job candidate’s spoken job pitch. In the transcript condition, participants read a transcription of the job candidate’s pitch. After hearing or reading the pitch, the participants rated the job candidates on three dimensions: intelligence, competence, and thoughtfulness. These ratings were then averaged to create a single measure of the job candidate’s intellect, with higher scores indicating the recruiters rated the candidates as higher in intellect. The participants also rated their overall impression of the job candidate (a composite of two items measuring positive and negative impressions). Finally, the participants indicated how likely they would be to recommend hiring the job candidate (0 - not at all likely, 10 - extremely likely). So, what happened? Did the recruiters think job applicants were smarter when they read the transcripts, or when the heard the applicants speak? We have the data, we can find out. 7.6.2 Performing an independent-samples t-test First, let’s open the relevant data file; Here is the link. It’s called “SchroederEpley2015_Study4_data.sav” Open this file in SPSS. Your data should look like this: For our analysis, we will focus on only one of the three measures mentioned above: intellect. We want to know if perceived intellect is different in the audio condition (where recruiters listened to a job pitch) than in the transcript condition (where recruiters read a transcript of a job pitch). Before we run the t-test, let’s introduce a button at the top of our SPSS spreadsheet window. This will be important for identifying the values assigned to groups later on. The button I refer to here is highlighted below; it has two boxes, one with an A and one with a 1 on it, with arrows in-between. Press this button and see what happens to your data spreadsheet: Notice that this button has revealed the values used to signify the Audio and Transcript groups. We will need to know that these groups are signified by 0s and 1s when we come to running our t-test. If you click the button again, the cells will go back to displaying their labels. Keep in mind that revealing the values or labels does not change anything about the data itself or any subsequent analyses; it is merely a cosmetic change. Now, we’re ready to run the independent-samples t-test. Go to Analyze, then Compare Means, then Independent Samples T-test… A window will appear asking you to specify which variable to use in this analysis. Remember, we are only using intellect, so find this variable in the left-hand list and move it into the “Test Variable(s)” field on the right using the arrow. For the field labeled “Grouping Variable”, we will specify which variable is our independent variable. That variable is Condition (we have two conditions: audio and transcript). Move Condition into the “Grouping Variable” field. Notice that next to the variable name there are two question marks and the OK button is disabled: Here, SPSS wants to know the values used to signify these conditions (remember the 0s and 1s?). So, click Define Groups, and place 0 and 1 in the fields that ask for Values for Group 1 and Group 2. Click Continue, and then OK. SPSS will produce output tables as follows: The t-test output is very similar to our previous t-test examples and can be interpreted similarly. In the case of an independent-samples t-test, there is one special consideration to be made: the equality of variances. One of the assumptions of a t-test is that the groups being compared have roughly equal variances. Conveniently, the independent-samples t-test performs another test within itself to determine if the variances are equal or not: this test is called the Levene’s test. In the second output table, there is a section dedicated to the Levene’s test. The rule is as follows: If the Sig. value under the Levene’s test heading is smaller than your alpha level, then your variances are NOT equal and you must refer to the values in the second row of the table, labeled “Equal variances not assumed.” If the Sig. value for Levele’s test is larger than alpha, then you can use the top row labeled “Equal variances assumed.” In this case, the Sig. value associated with the Levene’s test is .035, which is less than the conventional alpha level of .05. This means that the t-statistic for our independent-samples t-test is -3.398, the degrees of freedom are adjusted to 28.668, and the p-value for the t-test is .002. What does this mean? We can put our finding into words to clarify: Recruiter ratings for audio job pitches are 2.04 points higher than ratings for transcripts of pitches. This difference is significant, t(28.668)=-3.398, p&lt;.05. 7.6.3 Graphing your data Condition in this experiment represents a discrete, categorical variable. Therefore, we will be using a bar chart to visualize this data. To begin, go to Graphs, then Legacy Dialogs, then Bar… Next, choose Simple in the window that appears, then click Define. In the next window, make sure that under “Bars Represent”, you have chosen Other statistic. Move your variable of interest (intellect) into the field labeled “Variable.” Then, move CONDITION to the “category axis” field. Next, click Options. Then choose Display Error Bars, and have them represent Standard Error with a multiplier of 1. Click Continue, then OK. SPSS will produce a bar graph of your mean ratings for both audio and transcript conditions. 7.6.4 Practice Problems Use the same data file from this lab’s tutorial to test whether intelligence ratings were different between genders (use alpha = .05). Who was rated as more intelligent, males or females? Report your result in proper statistical reporting format. Graph this result (including 1 SEM error bars) as a bar graph. 7.7 JAMOVI How to do it in JAMOVI "],

A. Fisher This lab is modified and extended from Open Stats Labs. Thanks to Open Stats Labs (Dr. Kevin P. McIntyre) for their fantastic work. 8.1 How to not think about bad memories by playing Tetris This lab activity uses the open data from Experiment 2 of James et al. (2015) to teach one-way ANOVA with planned comparisons. Results of the activity provided below should exactly reproduce the results described in the paper. 8.1.1 STUDY DESCRIPTION Following traumatic experiences, some people have flashbacks, which are also called “intrusive memories”&quot; and are characterized by involuntary images of aspects of the traumatic event. Although people often try to simply forget traumatic memories, this approach is not very effective. Instead, previous research suggests that a better approach may be to try to change aspects of the memory after it is formed. For example, some research shows that traumatic memories can be altered and weakened to the point that they are no longer intrusive. Because intrusive memories of trauma are often visual in nature, James and colleagues (2015) sought to explore whether completing a visuospatial task (e.g., Tetris) after a memory was formed would interfere with the storage of that memory, and thereby reduce the frequency of subsequent intrusions. They hypothesized that only participants who complete a visuo-spatial task after reactivation of the traumatic memories would experience a reduction in intrusive memories. In comparison, simply completing a visuo-spatial task (without reactivation) or reactivation (without a visuo-spatial task), would not reduce the occurrence intrusive memories. In other words, if you play Tetris shortly after you were remembering bad memories, playing Tetris might weaken those memories, which could cause you experience those kinds of intrusive memories less often in the future. 8.1.2 Study Methods To test their hypothesis, the authors conducted an experiment ( N = 72, n = 18 per condition). The procedure is summarized as follows: Trauma Film: All participants viewed a series of video clips of graphic violence (e.g., a person getting hit by a van while using his phone as he crosses the road) as a way to create memories that should become intrusive memories. Participants then went home and recorded the number of intrusive memories they experienced over the next 24 hours. Because this is before the experimental manipulations, all groups were predicted to have an equal occurrence of intrusive memories during the first 24-hours (called Day 0). Experimental Task: After this 24-hour period, the participants returned to the lab and completed the experimental task. The experimenters randomly assigned participants to ONE of the following conditions: No-task control: These participants completed a 10-minute music filler task. Reactivation + Tetris: These participants were shown a series of images from the trauma film to reactivate the traumatic memories (i.e., reactivation task). After a 10-minute music filler task, participants played the video game Tetris for 12 minutes. Tetris Only: These participants played Tetris for 12 minutes, but did not complete the reactivation task. Reactivation Only: These participants completed the reactivation task, but did not play Tetris. Intrusive Memories: All participants were asked to record the number of intrusive memories that they experienced over the next seven days (Days 1 to 7). After the seven days had passed, participants completed an Intrusion-Provocation Task, in which they were shown blurred images from the trauma film and asked to indicate whether the blurred image triggered an intrusive memory. 8.2 Lab Skills Learned 8.3 Important Stuff citation: James, E.

But we do need look at the columns to see how the independent variable and dependent variables were coded. 8.4.3.1 The independent variable There was one important independent variable, and it had four levels. The first column in the data frame is called condition, and it has four levels. The levels are 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the data-frame. These will correspond to the four levels in shown in figure: No-task control Reactivation Plus Tetris Tetris only Reactivation only Each of these refer to what subjects did after they watched the traumatic film. But, which of these correspond to the numbers 1 to 4 in the data-frame? It turns out the are in the right order, and 1 to 4 refer to: No-task control Reactivation Plus Tetris Tetris only Reactivation only Let’s do ourselves a favor and rename the levels of the Condition column with words so we know what they refer to. First, convert the Condition column to a factor, then rename the levels. Then. all_data$Condition &lt;- as.factor(all_data$Condition) levels(all_data$Condition) &lt;- c(&quot;Control&quot;, &quot;Reactivation+Tetris&quot;, &quot;Tetris_only&quot;, &quot;Reactivation_only&quot;) 8.4.3.2 The dependent variable The authors showed two figures, one where they analysed intrusive memory frequency as the mean for the week, and the other where the used intrusive memory frequency on Day 7. In this tutorial, we will do the steps to run an ANOVA on the mean for the week data, and you will do follow these steps to run another ANOVA on the Day 7 data. The mean for the week data for each subject is apparently coded in the column Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions. 8.4.4 Look at the data Remember before we do any analysis, we always want to “look” at the data. This first pass let’s us know if the data “look right”. For example, the data file could be messed up and maybe there aren’t any numbers there, or maybe the numbers are just too weird. In the last two labs, we saw how to show all the data we are interested in looking at in one go. We can do the same things here. For example, in one little piece of code, we can display the means in each condition, the standard errors of the mean, and the individual scores for each subject in each condition. This is a lot to look at, but it’s everything we want to look at for starters all in the same place. Looking at the data this way will also give us intuitions about what our ANOVA will tell us before we run the ANOVA. This is helpful for determining whether the results of your ANOVA are accurate or not. Let’s do it…also notice that the code is very similar to what we did for the independent t-test. In fact, all I did was copy and paste that code right here, and edited it a little bit. This is really fast, and shows the efficiency of doing things this way. library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) # get means and SEs descriptive_df &lt;- all_data %&gt;% group_by(Condition) %&gt;% summarise(means= mean(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions), SEs = sd(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions)/sqrt(length(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions))) # Make the plot ggplot(descriptive_df, aes(x=Condition, y=means))+ geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, aes(fill=Condition))+ # add means geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=means-SEs, # add error bars ymax=means+SEs), width=.1) + geom_point(data=all_data, aes(x=Condition, y=Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions), alpha=.5)+ geom_point(alpha=.25)+ ylab(&quot;Intrusive Memories (Mean for Week)&quot;) There we have it. A nice graph showing us everything. We can see there was a lot of differences at the level of individual subjects. Some subjects had a mean of 15 intrusive memories for the week. Some had 0. Lots of differences. And, to be completely honest, this data seems a bit weird to me. It might not be weird, but it might be. The wording in the manuscript is that this data is the mean frequency of intrusive memories over the week. For the people who had 15, this means that every day they had on average 15 intrusive memories. Some people had on average 0 per day. This could be the data. But, it also seems like the data might just be frequency counts and not means at all. For example, the data could be that some people had a total of 15 intrusive over the week. The data might make more sense if these were frequency counts. Otherwise the differences between people are truly very large. For example the person who had an average of 15 intrusive memories per week, must have had 15*7 = 105 intrusive memories, which is a lot more than zero. In any case, this kind of wondering about the data is what happens when you start to notice how numbers work. It’s useful develop your data sense. Let’s move on to the ANOVA. By looking at the above graph do you have an intuition about what the ANOVA will tell us? I do, it should easily tell us that we are going to get an F-value that is bigger than one, and a p-value that is probably smaller than .05? How do I know this? I looked at the error bars, which represent the standard errors of the mean. If we look across conditions we can see that that the error bars don’t always overlap. This suggests there are differences in the data that don’t happen very often by chance. So, we expect a smallish p-value. Why do you think I expect the F-value to be greater than 1? If you can answer this question with a justification and explanation of how F works, pat yourself on the back! 8.4.5 Conduct the ANOVA Conducting an ANOVA in R is pretty easy. It’s one line of code, just like the t-test. It’s worth knowing that there are a few different packages out there to do an ANOVA, for example Mike Lawrence’s ezANOVA package is pretty popular. For this tutorial we’ll show you how to run the ANOVA using the aov function from base R (comes pre-installed). This is pretty “easy” too. I put easy in quotes because the first time I saw this, it was not easy for me. Here’s a brief digression for me to tell you that I feel your pain. I was first introduced to R by Patrick Bennett (a professor at McMaster University, where I attended graduate school). Pat, like I am doing know, forced us to use R in his statistics class. I remember having zero clue about so many things, and was often very frustrated. So, I imagine some of you are quite frustrated too. I was luck, like some of you, to have had some previous experience with other programming languages, so I was familiar with what R might be doing. What I was most frustrated with, was learning how to tell R what to do. In other words, I didn’t know how to write the commands properly. I didn’t understand what we call the syntax of R. This was back many years ago now, well before there was so many helpful examples on Google with working code, showing you how the syntax works. All we had was the R help files, which were a total mystery to me. If you want to see the help file for aov, just type ?aov() into the console, and press enter. You will see an “explanation” of how the aov function is supposed to work. You can use the same trick for any R function, like this ?name_of_function(). To be clear, you have to replace the letters name_of_function, with the name of the function. Some of you think that might be super obvious, but that is the kind of thing I did not think was obvious. So, when I read the help file for how to use the aov function, that is to learn what to put where, I didn’t feel like it was showing me what I needed to do. Usually, at the bottom of the help file, there are some examples, and these are helpful, but sometimes they are missing the example you need, and you are expected to generalize your knowledge of how aov works, to make it work for your problem. This is a catch-22 because if you don’t know how it works, you can’t generalize. IMO, you need a lot of examples of things that work. So, with that digression, I’m going to explain the syntax for the aov function. It looks like this: aov(DV ~ IV, dataframe) That probably looks really foreign. Let me explain. First you need write aov(). aov is the name of the function, followed by the brackets. The brackets are a sandwich. Sandwiches have a top and a bottom, and they enclose the things you put in the sandwich. We then put things inside the (), in specific ways to make the aov sandwich. The DV stands for the name of the dependent variable in the data frame. For us, this will be Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions. So, when we add that, our function will look like: aov(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions ~ IV, dataframe) Next, the ~ (tilda) stands for the word ‘by’. We are saying we want to analyse the Dependent variable by the conditions of the independent variable. The IV stands for the name of the column that is your independent variable. Our’s is called Condition. Adding that in, our formula looks like: aov(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions ~ Condition, dataframe) Finally, the last part is the name of the data-frame we are using. The aov function only works on long-form data, where each score on the dependent variable has it’s own row. Our’s is already set up this way! The name of our data-frame is all_data. We add that in, and it looks like: aov(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions ~ Condition, all_data) In English, this means, do an ANOVA on the dependent variable as a function of the independent variable, and use the data in my data frame. This is it for now. The aov function is very flexible because you can define different kinds of formulas (the DV ~ IV part). We’ll see other examples in later chapters. For now, this is all we need. Also, what’s cool, is that this will work for any single IV with any number of levels (conditions) 2 or greater. Fun. Let’s see it in action. aov(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions ~ Condition, all_data) ## Call: ## aov(formula = Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions ~ Condition, ## data = all_data) ## ## Terms: ## Condition Residuals ## Sum of Squares 114.8194 685.8333 ## Deg. of Freedom 3 68 ## ## Residual standard error: 3.175812 ## Estimated effects may be unbalanced What is this garbage? I don’t see an ANOVA table, what is this? You are seeing the raw print out of the aov function. Clearly, this is not helpful, it’s not what we want to see. Fortunately, R comes with another function called summary. What it does is summarize the results of functions like aov, and prints them out in a nicer way. Let’s see the summary function do it’s thing: summary(aov(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions ~ Condition, all_data)) ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## Condition 3 114.8 38.27 3.795 0.0141 * ## Residuals 68 685.8 10.09 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 Alright, now we have an ANOVA table we can look at. However, it still looks ugly, at least to me. When you are working inside an R Markdown document, you have some more options to make it look nice. We can use the kable and xtable function together, like this. library(xtable) aov_out&lt;-aov(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions ~ Condition, all_data) summary_out&lt;-summary(aov_out) knitr::kable(xtable(summary_out)) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) Condition 3 114.8194 38.27315 3.794762 0.0140858 Residuals 68 685.8333 10.08578 NA NA Now we see a nicer print out. Especially if we knit the document into a webpage. 8.4.6 Reporting the ANOVA results Refer tot the textbook on ANOVAs for a deeper discussion of all the things in the ANOVA table. We’ll remind about some of those things here. First, let’s look at how we might report the results. There are three very important parts to this. Saying what test you did to what data Reporting the inferential statistics Reporting the pattern in the means Here is part 1, we need to say what data we used, and what kind of test we used on that data: We submitted the mean intrusive memories for the week from each subject in each condition to a one-factor betwee-subjects ANOVA, with Intervention type (No-task control, Reactivation Plus tetris, Tetris only, Reactivation only) as the sole independent variable. Part 2 is saying what the results of the test were. Specifically, we report the values from the inferential test (see the textbook for why these values). Also, you should be able to answer this question: why do we report the values that we do? We found a main effect of Intervention type, F(3, 68) = 3.79, MSE = 10.09, p = 0.014. Part 3 is saying what the pattern was in the means. Remember, that in the ANOVA, a significant effect refers to the global variation among the means. In other words, we can say that there are some differences between the means, but we can’t specifically say which pairs of means are different, or which groups of means are different from one another. How can we report this, where are the means? In fact, we already found them when we plotted the data earlier. So, we can copy paste that code, and print out the means, rather than the figure: # get means and SEs descriptive_df &lt;- all_data %&gt;% group_by(Condition) %&gt;% summarise(means= mean(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions), SEs = sd(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions)/sqrt(length(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions))) knitr::kable(descriptive_df) Condition means SEs Control 5.111111 0.9963623 Reactivation+Tetris 1.888889 0.4113495 Tetris_only 3.888889 0.6806806 Reactivation_only 4.833333 0.7848650 No we have to use a sentence to describe these means. Refer to table 1 for the means and standard errors of the mean in each condition or, Mean intrusive memories per week were 5.11 (SE = .99); 1.89 (SE = .41); 3.89 (SE = .68); and 4.83 (SE= .78), in the Control, Reaction plus Tetris, Tetris Only, and Reactivation only conditions, respectively Ugh, what a mouthful. Be mindful of how you write results. The above is not helpful because you see a list of numbers, and then a list of conditions, and the reader has to do a lot of work to keep everything straight. I like the table option. I also like this other kind of option: Mean intrusive memories were significantly different between the Control (M = 5.11, SE = .99), Reactivation plus Tetris (M = 3.89, SE = .68), Tetris only (M= 3.89, SE = .68), and Reactivation only (M = 4.83, .78) conditions. That’s a little bit better. Let’s put it all in one place to see what it look like: We submitted the mean intrusive memories for the week from each subject in each condition to a one-factor betwee-subjects ANOVA, with Intervention type (No-task control, Reactivation Plus tetris, Tetris only, Reactivation only) as the sole independent variable. We found a main effect of Intervention type, F(3, 68) = 3.79, MSE = 10.09, p = 0.014. Mean intrusive memories were significantly different between the Control (M = 5.11, SE = .99), Reactivation plus Tetris (M = 3.89, SE = .68), Tetris only (M= 3.89, SE = .68), and Reactivation only (M = 4.83, .78) conditions. 8.4.7 Individual comparisons This next part is complicated, so we intentionally simplify it. There are these things (remember from the textbook), called comparisons. We use them to compare differences between specific conditions of interest. That part isn’t very complicated. You just pick the things you want to compare, and compare them. What is complicated is exactly what you “should” do to make the comparison. It turns out there are lots of recommendations and disagreements about what you should do. There are also lots of tests that you can do, so you have a lot of options. We are not going to show you here all of the tests. This is beyond the scope of what we are trying to teach you. Instead, we will use tests that you already know, the t-test for independent samples from the last lab. It will do the job for this data. We think that before you can make good decisions about the kind of comparison test you want to use, you have to have a solid understanding of what you are comparing and what you are not comparing when you use different tests. We think this understanding is more important than what test you use. More important, is that you know what means you want to compare. In this case, we will talk about what means we want to compare, and then just do a t-test. 8.4.7.1 What did the ANOVA tell us Remember, the ANOVA we conducted is termed the omnibus test in the textbook. What means was it comparing? It wasn’t comparing specific means. It was asking a kind of blind and very general question: Are any of these means different. Our answer was yes. Our next question is: What means were different from what other means? The ANOVA doesn’t know the answer to this question. It just says I don’t know… 8.4.7.2 Comparing specific means and the experimental question Notice there are 4 means to compare. So, there are (4-1)! = 3! = 3x2x1 = 6 total different comparisons. The ! stands for factorial. What’s more important is recognizing that when you have more than two conditions (where you can only make one comparison, A vs. B), you get increasingly more comparisons. For four conditions, A, B, C, D, you get six comparisons, they are: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, and CD where each letter pair refers to A compared to B (AB), A compared to C (AC), and so on. Do we actually care about all of these comparisons? Perhaps. What was the point of the experiment? Remember, the experiment was asking a questions, that’s why they set-up the condition necessary to produce these means. What question were they asking? What did they want to know? They wanted to find out if various interventions after watching the scary movie, would change how many bad intrusive memories people would experience in the week following the movie. They discuss the idea that a memory can become malleable when it is re-activated. They want to “Re-activate” the bad memories, and then while they were changeable, do something to them to make them less likely to be intrusive later on. The big idea was that doing a bit of “re-activation” AND then playing Tetris (which takes up visual cognitive bandwidth) could cause changes to the re-activated memories, that would decrease the number of intrusive memories later on. With that reminder, let’s go through some different comparisons that we can make, and talk about what they might mean. 8.4.7.3 Control vs. Reactivation_only There was a control group that did not do anything special after watching the traumatic movie. The mean number of intrusive memories for the control group, gives some idea of the amount of intrusive memories we would expect to measure, when you do nothing to change that number. Comparing to the control group is a very sensible thing do to for each of the other groups. If one of the manipulations worked, it should show a different mean (something changed) than the control group. So, did the Reaction_only group have less intrusive memories over the control group? First we use the filter function from dplyr to select only the rows from the data frame that have the Control and Reactivation_only conditions. Then we run a t-test comparison_df &lt;- all_data %&gt;% filter(Condition %in% c(&#39;Control&#39;,&#39;Reactivation_only&#39;)==TRUE) t.test(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions ~ Condition, comparison_df, var.equal=TRUE) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions by Condition ## t = 0.219, df = 34, p-value = 0.828 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -2.299851 2.855406 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group Control mean in group Reactivation_only ## 5.111111 4.833333 The means are both basically 5, not a big difference!. The p-value is large, suggesting that change could easily have produced the tiny differences between the means. In other words, it doesn’t look like the “re-activation” phase did anything to suppress the amount of intrusive memories that people would have over one week, compared to control. Notice, this was a comparison we could make. But, was it an informative one about the goal of the study? Not really. 8.4.7.4 Control vs. Reactivation+Tetris What we really want to know is if Reactivation+Tetris cause fewer intrusive memories…but compared to what? Well, if it did something, it should have a smaller mean than the Control group. So, let’s do that comparison: Note: we just change the one level name to the level we want Reactivation+Tetris. comparison_df &lt;- all_data %&gt;% filter(Condition %in% c(&#39;Control&#39;,&#39;Reactivation+Tetris&#39;)==TRUE) t.test(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions ~ Condition, comparison_df, var.equal=TRUE) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions by Condition ## t = 2.9893, df = 34, p-value = 0.005167 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 1.031592 5.412852 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group Control mean in group Reactivation+Tetris ## 5.111111 1.888889 There is a bigger difference now, roughly 5.1 intrusive memories for control, and 1.9 for Reactivation+Tetris. The p-value is quite small, indicating this difference was not likely produced by chance. Now, we have some evidence that Reactivation+Tetris caused something to change, that condition produced fewer intrusive memories than control. 8.4.7.5 Control vs. Tetris_only Now we can really start wondering what caused the difference. Was it just playing Tetris? It wasn’t just doing the reactivation, we already found out that didn’t do anything. Does just playing Tetris reduce the number of intrusive memories during the week? Let’s compare that to control: comparison_df &lt;- all_data %&gt;% filter(Condition %in% c(&#39;Control&#39;,&#39;Tetris_only&#39;)==TRUE) t.test(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions ~ Condition, comparison_df, var.equal=TRUE) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions by Condition ## t = 1.0129, df = 34, p-value = 0.3183 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -1.230036 3.674480 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group Control mean in group Tetris_only ## 5.111111 3.888889 There’s mean difference of about 1, but the p-value isn’t very small. This suggests chance produces a difference of this size fairly often. If we claimed that just playing Tetris caused a difference based on this data, we could easily be making a type I error (claiming the result is real when it is not, a false-positive). Still, the difference was in the right direction wasn’t it. 8.4.7.6 Tetris_only vs. Reactivation + Tetris Finally, we might ask if the Reactivation+Tetris group had fewer unwanted memories than the Tetris_only group. Did putting the two things together (reactivation AND Tetris) really do something special here, beyond just playing Tetris. comparison_df &lt;- all_data %&gt;% filter(Condition %in% c(&#39;Tetris_only&#39;,&#39;Reactivation+Tetris&#39;)==TRUE) t.test(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions ~ Condition, comparison_df, var.equal=TRUE) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions by Condition ## t = -2.5147, df = 34, p-value = 0.01681 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -3.6162855 -0.3837145 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group Reactivation+Tetris mean in group Tetris_only ## 1.888889 3.888889 Well, according to the t-test, the p-value is again fairly small. Suggesting that the difference between Reactivation+Tetris (M=1.89) and Tetris_only (3.89), was not likely to be produced by chance. So, on the basis of this, there is some evidence that Reactivation+Tetris, really does cause fewer intrusive memories. 8.4.8 Writing it all up. Because we have spent so much time on individual comparisons, we won’t do a full write up of the results. A full write-up would include telling the reader what data was used, what test was conducted, the results of the test, and the pattern of the means, AND then, the results of specific comparisons of interest. You can read the paper to see how the authors did it. 8.4.9 Food for thought Think about what we did here. We almost blindly just downloaded the data and ran the same analysis as the authors did. Sure, we looked at the data first, and then did the analysis. But, did we really look? Did you notice anything about what you looked at? What did we not look closely at that might make you skeptical of the conclusions from the research… Here’s a hint. Sample-size. We know that is important. Let’s ask the question, was there an equal number of participants in each of the 4 conditions. We can use dplyr again to do this. We’ll add the length function, which counts the number of subjects in each condition: descriptive_df &lt;- all_data %&gt;% group_by(Condition) %&gt;% summarise(means= mean(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions), SEs = sd(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions)/sqrt(length(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions)), count = length(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions)) knitr::kable(descriptive_df) Condition means SEs count Control 5.111111 0.9963623 18 Reactivation+Tetris 1.888889 0.4113495 18 Tetris_only 3.888889 0.6806806 18 Reactivation_only 4.833333 0.7848650 18 The answer is YES, there were an equal number of subjects. That’s good. We should have checked that before. Lesson for next time. For example, if there were only 9 subjects in the Reactivation+Tetris group, we might be suspicious that they got lucky, and accidentally (by chance) assigned people to that group who are unlikely to report having intrusive memories. After all, different people are different, and not everybody is as susceptible to intrusive memories. Let’s do one more thing for fun, and to see everything in action all in one place. Let’s consider the role of outliers. Looking at the first graph we can see that most people in all the groups had fewer than 10 intrusive memories (mean we assume) per week. It looks like 5 people had more than that, and they just happened to be in the other groups. Maybe Reactivation+Tetris made those people have way less intrusive memories (which is why no one is above 10), or maybe the researchers got a little bit unlucky, and accidentally didn’t get any “outliers” (people with extreme values on the measure) in that group. Let’s re-run the analysis, but remove anybody with a mean higher than 10. This will only remove 5 subjects, so we will still have a lot left. What happens? Before we find out, let me point out again the beauty of R. All we need to do is copy and paste our previous code. Then, just filter the data once to remove the outliers, then voila, we redo everything all in one go. It’s much more complicated and time consuming to do this in many other software programs. You are lucky to be learning R. # get rid out of outliers all_data &lt;- all_data %&gt;% filter(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions &lt; 10) # get means and SEs descriptive_df &lt;- all_data %&gt;% group_by(Condition) %&gt;% summarise(means= mean(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions), SEs = sd(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions)/sqrt(length(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions))) # Make the plot ggplot(descriptive_df, aes(x=Condition, y=means))+ geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, aes(fill=Condition))+ # add means geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=means-SEs, # add error bars ymax=means+SEs), width=.1) + geom_point(data=all_data, aes(x=Condition, y=Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions), alpha=.5)+ geom_point(alpha=.25)+ ylab(&quot;Intrusive Memories (Mean for Week)&quot;) # run and report the ANOVA aov_out&lt;-aov(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions ~ Condition, all_data) summary_out&lt;-summary(aov_out) knitr::kable(xtable(summary_out)) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) Condition 3 51.49152 17.163841 4.024458 0.0110347 Residuals 63 268.68758 4.264882 NA NA # conduct critical comparisons ## control vs reactivation+Tetris comparison_df &lt;- all_data %&gt;% filter(Condition %in% c(&#39;Control&#39;,&#39;Reactivation+Tetris&#39;)==TRUE) t.test(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions ~ Condition, comparison_df, var.equal=TRUE) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions by Condition ## t = 2.4159, df = 31, p-value = 0.02178 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.2562181 3.0326708 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group Control mean in group Reactivation+Tetris ## 3.533333 1.888889 ## Tetris_only vs reactivation+Tetris comparison_df &lt;- all_data %&gt;% filter(Condition %in% c(&#39;Tetris_only&#39;,&#39;Reactivation+Tetris&#39;)==TRUE) t.test(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions ~ Condition, comparison_df, var.equal=TRUE) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions by Condition ## t = -2.3239, df = 33, p-value = 0.02643 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -2.8561054 -0.1896463 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group Reactivation+Tetris mean in group Tetris_only ## 1.888889 3.411765 The take home is that yes, even after removing outliers, the same basic pattern in the data is observed. Overall, this is a small n study, and ideally the basic findings should be replicated in another lab before we really have full confidence in them. But, I’d say the trends here look promising. That’s ANOVA. Come back next week for another ANOVA tutorial, this time using within-subject data. It’s called a repeated measures ANOVA, and it’s what’s happening next week. 8.4.10 Generalization Exercise Your task is to conduct the ANOVA using Day_Zero_Number_of_Instrusions as the dependent variable.

(2015) study sought to explore whether completing a visuospatial task (e.g., Tetris) after a memory was formed would interfere with the storage of that memory, and thereby reduce the frequency of subsequent intrusions. They hypothesized that only participants who complete a visuo-spatial task after reactivation of the traumatic memories would experience a reduction in intrusive memories. In comparison, simply completing a visuo-spatial task (without reactivation) or reactivation (without a visuo-spatial task), would not reduce the occurrence intrusive memories.In other words, if you play Tetris shortly after you were remembering bad memories, you will experience intrusive memories less often in the future. The authors conducted an experiment ( N = 72, n = 18 per condition) wherein all participants viewed a series of video clips of graphic violence (e.g., a person getting hit by a van while using his phone as he crosses the road). Pver the next 24 hours, participants recorded their intrusive memories. All groups were predicted to have an equal occurrence of intrusive memories during this pre-manipulation period (called Day 0). Experimental Task: After this 24-hour period, the participants returned to the lab and completed the experimental task. The experimenters randomly assigned participants to ONE of the following conditions: No-task control: These participants completed a 10-minute music filler task. Reactivation + Tetris: These participants were shown a series of images from the trauma film to reactivate the traumatic memories (i.e., reactivation task). After a 10-minute music filler task, participants played the video game Tetris for 12 minutes. Tetris Only: These participants played Tetris for 12 minutes, but did not complete the reactivation task. Reactivation Only: These participants completed the reactivation task, but did not play Tetris. Dependent variable: Intrusive Memories: All participants were asked to record the number of intrusive memories that they experienced over the next seven days (Days 1 to 7). 8.6.2 Performing a One-Factor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) &amp; Graphing the data First, let’s open the relevant data file; Here is the link. It’s called “James2015_Experiment2.sav” Open this file in SPSS. Your data should look like this: In this experiment, there was one important independent variable, called condition, and it has four levels. The levels are 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the spreadsheet. These will correspond to the four levels in shown below: No-task control Reactivation Plus Tetris Tetris only Reactivation only The dependent variable is coded in the column Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions. This represents the mean number of intrusions for that week. We are testing the hypothesis that the number of intrusive memories will be different among the groups (1-4). For now, we will not specify which group we think is going to have the highest or lowest number of memories, but rather we will test if there is a difference SOMEWHERE between these 4 groups. Let’s begin. Go to Analyze, then Compare Means, then select One-Way ANOVA… The next window will ask you to specify the dependent variable (move the variable Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions from the list on the left to the field labeled Dependent Variable) and the “Factor”“, which is the same thing as the independent variable or grouping variable (remember back to t-tests!). Move the variable Condition from the list into the field labeled”Factor“. Your window should look like this: Now, click the Options button, and then choose Means plot. Then, click Continue and OK. SPSS will produce an output window containing the results of the ANOVA (an ANOVA table), as well as a graph of the group means. It should look as follows: First, let’s look at our ANOVA table: We see our F-statistic listed is 3.795, with a p-value o .014. This tests the null hypothesis that there is no difference among the groups. Since p is less than our likely alpha level (.05), we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there IS a difference somewhere among these groups. We may say it more formally as follows: The effect of condition on mean intrusive memories over days 1-7 was significant, F(3, 68)=3.795, p&lt;.05. To examine the data further, let’s refer to the graph created by SPSS: we can see that the Reactivation + Tetris condition appears to have the smallest mean. As for the others, they are all greater than Reactivation + Tetris, but differ somewhat from each other as well. It is important to know that at this point, we do not know where the significant differences could be. For example, it could be that only Reactivation + Tetris is different from No-Task Control, or it could be that there are other groups different from one another as well. In order to locate where the differences are, we must conduct additional analyses called either planned or unplanned comparisons. 8.6.3 Planned Comparisons: T-tests To find out where the differences are, one approach is to conduct as many t-tests as 2-group comparisons (also called pairwise comparisons) you can make out of your groups. That is, if you have 4 groups like we do, we can make the following pairwise comparisons: groups 1 vs. 2 groups 1 vs. 3 groups 1 vs. 4 groups 2 vs. 3 groups 2 vs. 4 groups 3 vs. 4 For each of these, we can run a separate independent-samples t-test. Let’s start with the first comparison (Groups 1 and 2). Go to Analyze, then Compare Means, then Independent-Samples t-test… Let’s place our dependent variable (Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions) in its appropriate field. Then, place Condition into the Factor field. Remember here that we have to click Define Groups to specify which groups we are comparing. Let’s put 1 and 2 in the fields from Group 1 and Group 2, as follows: Click Continue and then OK. SPSS will produce the standard output tables for an independent-samples t-test. As we can see, our t-test is significant; there is indeed a difference between groups 1 and 2, t(22.632)= 2.989, p&lt;.05. Now, that covers the comparison between groups 1 and 2. We now need to do the same thing for the rest of the comparisons (there are 5 comparisons left to conduct). The procedure for conducting these t-tests is the same as described here, and will only differ in the Define Groups stage of setting up the analysis; in this step, we used the numbers 1 and 2 to represent groups 1 and 2, but for the remainder of the comparisons you will use 1 and 3, 1 and 4, 2 and 3, 2 and 4, and so on. 8.6.4 Unplanned Comparisons: Post-hoc tests Another way to find the differences between groups in a One-Factor ANOVA is to conduct something called a post-hoc test. This test is referred to as “unplanned” because you only conduct one when you have a significant overall ANOVA. The post-hoc test is neat because it is conveniently summoned during the process of conducting an ANOVA, and presents its results in a compact table. Let’s use a post-hoc test to look at this data. Although there are many types of post-hoc tests, we’re going to conduct the commonly-used Tukey post-hoc test in this example. Let’s begin. We are going to go through the same steps as before in order to conduct our ANOVA: Go to Analyze, then Compare Means, then One-Way ANOVA… Place the dependent variable (Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions) in its appropriate field. Then, place Condition into the “Factor”&quot; field. Now, click the button labeled Post-hoc. A window will appear with options for various post-hoc tests. We are going to choose Tukey: Click Continue, and then OK. SPSS will produce the ANOVA table once again, followed by two tables that refer to the post-hoc test. Let’s look at the first table, named “Multiple Comparisons:” 8.6.4.1 Multiple Comparisons In this table, every possible group of 2 conditions is being compared. Notice that the table is redundant; it considers the comparison between no-task control and reactivation + tetris to be different from reactivation + tetris vs. no-task control. However, we know these are the same comparisons. So, we only need to look at half of the table, in essence. If you start with row 1, this row compares no-task control with reactivation + tetris. If we find the Sig. column, we see the corresponding p-value for this row is .017. Because this is less than our likely alpha level (.05), this means that these two conditions ARE significantly different from one another. Where else is there a Sig. that is less than alpha (.05)? Reactivation + Tetris compared with Reactivation only has a p-value of .034. This is also a significant difference. These are the only significant differences we see here. This means that, among the 4 groups, only two differences were found: Reactivation + tetris is different from no-task control, and reactivation + tetris is different from reactivation only. 8.6.4.2 Homogeneous Subsets This table actually gives you the same kind of information as the above table, but is more compact and easier to use. In this table you will see the conditions listed on the left, and a number of “subsets”–in this case there are 2 subsets (2 columns labeled 1 and 2, respectively). In these columns, the means of the conditions are listed (in this case, mean number of intrusive memories). The way to read a homogeneous subsets table is as simple as follows: If the means of two groups ever appear in the same column together, they are not significantly different from one another. If the means of two groups NEVER appear in the same column together, then they ARE significantly different from one another. Let’s start with Reactivation + Tetris and Tetris Only. Look at the table to determine if the means of these conditions ever appear in the same column together. The answer should be yes. The Reactivation + tetris mean (1.89) and Tetris only mean (3.89) appear in column 1 together. Now, let’s move on to Reactivation + Tetris as compared to Reactivation only. Do the means of these two groups ever appear in the same column together? No. The Reactivation + Tetris mean (1.89) only appears in column 1, and the reactivation only mean (4.83) only appears in column 2. This means they are different. If you go through every possible comparison of two groups, you will find that the only differences are between: reactivation + tetris vs. reactivation only reactivation + tetris vs. no-task control These are the same pairwise differences we noted using the multiple comparisons table. 8.6.5 Practice Problems Using this lab’s data set, think about the following question: What if participants’ intrusive memories were not actually affected by the manipulation (tetris and reactivation), but rather the group with the most intrusive memories just happened to react more strongly to the disturbing films? What if there were differences in “level of disturbance” (hint hint: post-film distress rating) among the 4 groups? Test this hypothesis using an alpha level of .05. Report your result in proper statistical reporting format. What do you conclude? Do the same type of analysis to determine whether the amount of attention paid to the film differed between the 4 groups. Report your result in proper statistical reporting format. What do you conclude? 8.7 JAMOVI How to do it in JAMOVI "],

A. Fisher 9.1 Betcha can’t type JHDBZKCO very fast on your first try This lab activity uses the data from Behmer &amp; Crump (2017) to teach one-factor repeated measures ANOVA with-up follow comparisons 9.1.1 STUDY DESCRIPTION Behmer &amp; Crump (2017) used the everyday task of typing on a computer keyboard to ask questions about how people learn to put sequences of actions together. Whenever you type a series of letters on the keyboard, you are putting a sequence of actions together, so typing is task that could be used to measure skilled sequencing. Typing also happens to be a convenient task for measuring sequencing. For example, every time a person types a letter, the timing of the button press and the letter pressed can be measured and stored for later analysis. Behmer &amp; Crump were interested in asking a few different questions, however, we will simplify everything and talk about replication. First we describe an interesting finding from previous research. Behmer &amp; Crump repeated an experiment that should also produce this same finding. If they succeed in doing this, it means the finding can be replicated, and that it happens in more than one lab. Finding from previous resaearch: Prior research showed that typists do something funny. Skilled typists can type normal words very fast. This suggests they know how to locate all of the letters on the keyboard, and can press each letter very quickly to type words. That part isn’t particularly funny. However, if you take really skilled typists and make them type random letters like this: kwitb dhhgjtryq xkldpt mazhyffdt, guess what happens? They slow down a lot. It’s kind of weird that a typist would slow down, after all they can type letters really fast when they appear in words, but not when they appear in random orders…what gives? Last, it turns out that typists are kind of in the middle in terms of speed, if you ask them to type non-words that have similar properties to words, such as: quenp hamlke phwempy. To summarize, prior research showed that typing speed changes as a function of the structure of the text, roughly in this order from fastest to slowest. (FASTEST) Normal Words &lt; Word-like Non-words &lt; Random strings (SLOWEST) Replication question: Behmer &amp; Crump also measured typists while they typed words, non-words that were English-like, and random strings. They had some additional things they were interested in, but for us, we are interested in whether they would show the same effect. Would they replicate the pattern: Normal words (Fastest) &lt; Word-like Non-words (medium) &lt;- Random strings (Slowest)? 9.1.2 Study Methods The authors conducted a repeated measures experiment. A total of 38 subjects were used for the analysis. Independent Variable: The IV Stimulus or typing material had three levels: Normal, Bigrams, and Random. Normal refers to normal 5 letter English words (like truck, or plant). Bigrams refers to non-words that have properties similar to words (e.g., phemt quilp). Random refers to 5 letter strings whose letters were totally random (qmklt gdrzn lprni). Dependent Variables: There were three dependent variables, that all measured different aspects of typing performance. Reaction times (RTs) were defined as the temporal interval between seeing a stimulus (to type), and then starting to type it (first key press). Inter-keystroke intervals (IKSIs) are the times between each key-press. Last, accuracy was also measured (correct or incorrect key-presses) The task: Participants (who happened to also be students from Brooklyn College) sat in front a computer. They were presented with one stimulus (word, bigrams, or random) at a time. As soon as they saw the string of letters, they typed it as quickly and accurately as they could, then they moved on to the next trial. Reminder, this is a repeated measures design because each participant typed letter strings from the word, bigrams, and random conditions. 9.2 Lab Skills Learned Conducting a one-factor repeated measures ANOVA Conducting follow-up comparisons 9.3 Important Stuff citation: Behmer, Lawrence P., Crump, M.

Below is how to load the .csv data from the online repository, or from a local file (you need to change the file path to where the local file is, if you downloaded it). The data contains all of the measures and conditions from Experiment 1 in the paper. library(data.table) #all_data &lt;- fread(&quot;https://github.com/CrumpLab/statisticsLab/raw/master/data/exp1_BehmerCrumpAPP.csv&quot;) all_data &lt;- fread(&quot;data/exp1_BehmerCrumpAPP.csv&quot;) 9.4.2 Inspect the dataframe This will give you a big picture of the data frame. Click the button to view it in your browser, then take a look to see what is in it. library(summarytools) view(dfSummary(all_data[,c(1:7,10:20)])) Note, there is some weird stuff in code above. Normally, we would just write view(dfSummary(all_data)), why we add this: all_data[,c(1:7,10:20)]? It turns out the dfSummary function didn’t like some of the data. In particular it didn’t like the data in columns 8 an 9 (notice those numbers are missing, the range inside c is 1 to 7 and 10 to 20). It doesn’t mean the data isn’t there, just that it didn’t want to display it in the viewer. 9.4.3 Get the data you need This data file contains all of the data from Experiment 1 in the paper. So, we don’t need to get rid of any rows. There are numerous columns, some of them we don’t need for the analysis. But, we’ll just ignore these later when we use dplyr to group by the columns we want. The structure of this data a file is in long form. Every row described a measurement for a single key-press. For example, the first 5 rows, have data for the timing of the first 5 key-presses, that the first subject made to type the first string of letters they saw. In total there were 85,410 key-presses made. That’s quite a lot. 9.4.3.1 The independent variable The important independent variable is in the column Stimulus. Normal (5 letter English words) Bigrams (5 letter strings that kind of looked like words) Random (5 letter strings that were random) It is also important to know that the Order column codes the position for each letter, from 1 to 5. Note: there was another independent variable in the study as well. We talk about this later. The second IV is coded in the Block column. Baseline (normal typing, keyboard is visible while typing) Manipulation (occluded typing, keyboard is covered while typing) 9.4.3.2 The dependent variables TimeFromOnset : This column records the temporal interval in milliseconds between the onset of the word and each key-press. When order is 1 (first keystroke), the number here is the reaction time to start typing. PureRTs : This column contains keystroke intervals. The first interval is between the onset of the word and the first key-press (order 1), the second interval is between the first and second key-press (order 2), and so on. PureRTs for orders 2 to 5, represent the inter-keystroke intervals reported in paper. AllCorrect : 0 means incorrect (wrong letter was typed), 1 means correct (correct letter was typed) 9.4.4 Look at the data Remember before we do any analysis, we always want to “look” at the data. This first pass let’s us know if the data “look right”. For example, the data file could be messed up and maybe there aren’t any numbers there, or maybe the numbers are just too weird. For example, this study involves reaction times: the time between seeing something and responding to it. If you had done a study like this before, you would know that it usually doesn’t take people that long to start responding. Most reaction times will be under a second (or 1000 milliseconds). But, sometime people are little slow, and sometimes they do funny things like check their phone in the middle of an experiment. Before I analyze reaction time data, I often make a histogram of all of the RT data, like this: hist(all_data$PureRTs) We can see that almost all of the reaction times are well below 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds), which is good. Most of the time people were paying attention and not “checking their phone”. Notice, the range of the histogram goes out to 15,000 milliseconds. You can’t see any bars out there (too small to notice), but there must be at least a few trials where somebody took 15 seconds to start responding. These are called outliers. We will remove them before we conduct our analysis 9.4.5 Look at the means As part of looking at the data, we might as well make a figure that shows the mean reaction times in each condition, and some error bars to look at the spread in each condition. The following code takes three important steps: Get the means for each subject in each condition. These are put into the data frame called subject_means. Get the means for each condition, by averaging over the means for each subject. These are put into the data frame called plot_means. Make a graph with the plot_means data frame using ggplot2. library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) all_data$Block&lt;-as.factor(all_data$Block) levels(all_data$Block) &lt;- c(&quot;Visible keyboard&quot;,&quot;Covered Keyboard&quot;) ## get subject mean RTs subject_means &lt;- all_data %&gt;% filter(Order==1, Correct==1, PureRTs&lt;5000) %&gt;% group_by(Subject, Block, Stimulus) %&gt;% summarise(mean_rt = mean(PureRTs)) subject_means$Subject&lt;-as.factor(subject_means$Subject) subject_means$Block&lt;-as.factor(subject_means$Block) subject_means$Stimulus&lt;-as.factor(subject_means$Stimulus) ## get condition mean RTs plot_means &lt;- subject_means %&gt;% group_by(Block, Stimulus) %&gt;% summarise(means = mean(mean_rt), SEs = sd(mean_rt)/sqrt(length(mean_rt))) ## plot the condition means # re-order stimulus factor for plotting plot_means$Stimulus &lt;- factor(plot_means$Stimulus, levels = c(&quot;Normal&quot;, &quot;Bigrams&quot;, &quot;Random&quot;)) ggplot(plot_means, aes(x=Stimulus, y=means, group=Block, color=Block))+ geom_point()+ geom_line()+ geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=means-SEs, ymax=means+SEs), width=.2)+ theme_classic()+ ylab(&quot;Mean Reaction Time (ms)&quot;)+ xlab(&quot;Typing Material&quot;) Alright, we made things a little bit more complicated than they need to be. Our primary question is whether reaction times followed this pattern: Normal &lt; Bigrams &lt; Random. We can see the means do follow this pattern. However, shouldn’t we only be looking at three means, why are their six means, and two lines? The above code included the second independent variable Block. As a result, you are seeing the means for Typing material when subjects could see the keyboard, and when the couldn’t see the keyboard. We will come back to this later. For now, let’s ignore the Block condition, and find the means for the Typing Material IV by averaging over the Block conditions. We run the same code as above, by take out Block, in the group_by function. We also take Block out the ggplot function. VERY IMPORTANT: We did something in the above code that we didn’t point out. We filtered the data before we found the means. For most of the data sets in other labs, we given you data that is more or less ready to analyse. More often than not data needs to be pre-processed, or filtered before you analyze it. We can use the filter function in dplyr to do our filtering. filter filters the rows for us, so we will only include the rows that we want. We want to analyze the time between the onset of the stimulus and the first keystroke. The reaction times for this value are in the PureRTs column, but this column contains other RTs that we do not want to analyse. For example, the Order column codes for the letter position in the string. We only want to analyze the rows that contain a 1, for the first position. So, that is why we add Order==1 to the filter function below. We want to analyze only the reaction times that are correct. That is, when the subject typed the first letter correctly, and did not make a typo. Accuracy is coded in the Correct column, with 1 = correct, and 0 = incorrect. We add Correct==1 to the filtering function. Note the use of ==, that is two equal signs in a row. In R, two equal signs in a row has a special meaning. It means conduct a logic test to determine if one thing is the same as another. We want to analyze only reaction times that are “sensible” to analyze. What does sensible mean? We don’t want to analyze data that is clearly garbage data. For example, if someone fell asleep at the computer and didn’t respond for 15 seconds, that kind of data is not what we want to analyze. If we were to filter the data, and exclude these kinds of outliers, we would be conducting an outlier elimination procedure. Behmer &amp; Crump (2017) did this, and it is commonly done in many different kinds of studies. We skip an extended discussion of outlier elimination for this lab. But, we do introduce the idea of doing it. We want to keep as much of the data as possible. So, what we do is keep all of the RTs that are less than 5000 ms (that’s 5 seconds). To do this, we add PureRTs&lt;5000 to the filter function. ## get subject mean RTs subject_means &lt;- all_data %&gt;% filter(Order==1, Correct==1, PureRTs&lt;5000) %&gt;% group_by(Subject, Stimulus) %&gt;% summarise(mean_rt = mean(PureRTs)) subject_means$Subject&lt;-as.factor(subject_means$Subject) subject_means$Stimulus&lt;-as.factor(subject_means$Stimulus) ## get condition mean RTs plot_means &lt;- subject_means %&gt;% group_by(Stimulus) %&gt;% summarise(means = mean(mean_rt), SEs = sd(mean_rt)/sqrt(length(mean_rt))) ## plot the condition means # re-order stimulus factor for plotting plot_means$Stimulus &lt;- factor(plot_means$Stimulus, levels = c(&quot;Normal&quot;, &quot;Bigrams&quot;, &quot;Random&quot;)) ggplot(plot_means, aes(x=Stimulus, y=means, group=1))+ geom_point()+ geom_line(stat=&quot;identity&quot;)+ geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=means-SEs, ymax=means+SEs), width=.2)+ theme_classic()+ ylab(&quot;Mean Reaction Time (ms)&quot;)+ xlab(&quot;Typing Material&quot;) 9.4.6 Conduct the repeated Measures ANOVA We use the same aov function as we used last time. The only difference is that we add in a new part to the formula. Remember the formula for a one-factor between subjects ANOVA looked like this: aov( DV ~ IV , dataframe), where DV is the name of the column with your independent variable, IV is the name of the column with your independent variable, and dataframe is the name of your data frame containing the means in each condition. The formula for a repeated-measures ANOVA looks like this: aov( DV ~ IV + Error(Subject/IV), dataframe). We have added + Error(Subject/IV). This tells R to use the appropriate error term for the repeated measures ANOVA. In the formula, Subject refers to the name of the column coding your subjects (make sure this is a factor in R), and IV is the name of the column for your independent variable. The formula for our data would be: aov( mean_rt ~ Stimulus + Error(Subject/Stimulus), subject_means). Here is the code below. Just as reminder, the raw data codes every single key press on each row. We don’t want to submit this as the data frame to the aov function. Instead, we need to calculate the data frame for the subject means in each condition. We did that above as a step toward making the graphs. We do it again here to remind you that you need to do this. # get subject means subject_means &lt;- all_data %&gt;% filter(Order==1, Correct==1, PureRTs&lt;5000) %&gt;% group_by(Subject, Stimulus) %&gt;% summarise(mean_rt = mean(PureRTs)) # Make sure IV and Subject are coded as factors subject_means$Subject &lt;- as.factor(subject_means$Subject) subject_means$Stimulus &lt;- as.factor(subject_means$Stimulus) # Conduct the anova aov_out &lt;- aov( mean_rt ~ Stimulus + Error(Subject/Stimulus), subject_means) summary_out &lt;- summary(aov_out) library(xtable) knitr::kable(xtable(summary_out)) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) Residuals 37 3030779.9 81912.970 NA NA Stimulus 2 1157965.2 578982.606 230.5806 0 Residuals1 74 185812.3 2510.977 NA NA Great, we have conducted the ANOVA. We could write up the results of the ANOVA like this: For each subject we computed mean reactions for correct keystrokes in each condition of the Stimulus factor. These means were submitted to a one-factor repeated-measures ANOVA, with Stimulus (Normal, Bigrams, and Random) as the sole factor. The effect of Stimulus was signficant, F(2, 74) = 230.58, MSE = 2510.98, p &lt; 0.001. Note, the p-value shows up as a zero, that’s because it is so small that R doesn’t want to print the actual number 0.000000000000000…1. What does this tell us? The \\(F\\) value we obtained (230.58) almost never occurs by chance. More specifically, the sampling distribution of F from the distribution of no differences virtually never produces a huge F like 230.58 It is super-duper unlikely that chance (sampling error) could have produced the difference we observed. We reject the idea that chance caused the differences, and are very confident that the manipulation (changing the kinds of letters that people have to type), has a causal influence on reaction time in typing. 9.4.6.1 Report the means too Remember, the important goal when conducting analyses, and then writing about them, is to tell people what you did and what you found. This involves more than one step. For this example, we might do three basic things. 1) make a figure to show the means, 2) report the ANOVA so people know if there is support for the inference that the differences between the means are not caused by chance, and 3) report descriptives for the means, so people know what the numbers are (the figure doesn’t show the exact values). We’ve already made the figure and done the ANOVA, let’s report the condition means. To do this, we need to find the means for each condition, collapsing over the means for each subject in each condition. Note that, we already did this to make the figure. Here’s the code again: ## get subject mean RTs subject_means &lt;- all_data %&gt;% filter(Order==1, Correct==1, PureRTs&lt;5000) %&gt;% group_by(Subject, Stimulus) %&gt;% summarise(mean_rt = mean(PureRTs)) subject_means$Subject&lt;-as.factor(subject_means$Subject) subject_means$Stimulus&lt;-as.factor(subject_means$Stimulus) ## get condition mean RTs plot_means &lt;- subject_means %&gt;% group_by(Stimulus) %&gt;% summarise(means = mean(mean_rt), SEs = sd(mean_rt)/sqrt(length(mean_rt))) knitr::kable(plot_means) Stimulus means SEs Bigrams 924.8764 26.69375 Normal 833.1872 24.00055 Random 1077.5361 31.60979 Now, our fu ll write-up of the results would look like this. For each subject we computed mean reactions for correct keystrokes in each condition of the Stimulus factor. These means were submitted to a one-factor repeated-measures ANOVA, with Stimulus (Normal, Bigrams, and Random) as the sole factor. The effect of Stimulus was signficant, F(2, 74) = 230.58, MSE = 2510.98, p &lt; 0.001. The mean reaction time was fastest in the Normal condition (M = 833 ms, SE = 24 ms), followed by the Bigram condition, (M = 924 ms, SE = 27 ms) and slowest in the Random Condition (M = 1078 ms, SE = 32 ms). 9.4.7 Follow-up comparisons The ANOVA tells us that the differences between the means are unlikely to be due to chance. But, remember, this is an omnibus test. It does not tell us if specific pairs of means are different from one another. To determine whether the difference between two specific means is not likely due to chance, we need to conduct follow-up tests. Because this is a repeated-measures design, we can use the paired-samples t-test for follow-up tests. Let’s do two follow-up tests to confirm that the RTs for Normal words were indeed faster than the RTs for the Bigram condition (word-like non-words); and then, let’s confirm that the RTs for the Bigram condition were indeed faster than the RTs for the Random condition. 9.4.7.1 Normal vs Bigrams We use the subject_means data frame. But, we want to rid of all the rows containing the means from the Random condition. We use filter to do that, then we conduct the paired-samples t-test. comparison_df &lt;- subject_means %&gt;% filter(Stimulus != &quot;Random&quot;) t.test(mean_rt~Stimulus, paired=TRUE, var.equal=TRUE, data = comparison_df) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: mean_rt by Stimulus ## t = 12.14, df = 37, p-value = 1.807e-14 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 76.38601 106.99253 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## 91.68927 9.4.7.2 Bigrams vs Random We use the subject_means data frame. But, we want to rid of all the rows containing the means from the Normal condition. We use filter to do that, then we conduct the paired-samples t-test. comparison_df &lt;- subject_means %&gt;% filter(Stimulus != &quot;Normal&quot;) t.test(mean_rt~Stimulus, paired=TRUE, var.equal=TRUE, data = comparison_df) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: mean_rt by Stimulus ## t = -14.212, df = 37, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -174.4245 -130.8949 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## -152.6597 9.4.8 Reporting everything Now we can look at some write-ups that report everything we did, and everything we want to know. I’ll show you two ways to do it. 9.4.8.1 First way In the first way, we embed the results of the t-test into the description of the mean reaction times. For each subject we computed mean reactions for correct keystrokes in each condition of the Stimulus factor. These means were submitted to a one-factor repeated-measures ANOVA, with Stimulus (Normal, Bigrams, and Random) as the sole factor. The effect of Stimulus was significant, F(2, 74) = 230.58, MSE = 2510.98, p &lt; 0.001. The mean reaction time was significantly faster in the Normal condition (M = 833 ms, SE = 24 ms), compared to the Bigram condition, (M = 924 ms, SE = 27 ms), t(37) = 12.14, p&lt;0.001. Additionally, mean reactions in the Bigram condition were significantly faster than the Random Condition (M = 1078 ms, SE = 32 ms), t(37) = 14.21, p &lt; 0.001. 9.4.8.2 Second way In the second way, we first report the means as we did the very first time, and then after that we report the t-test results to highlight the size the of the differences between each comparison. For each subject we computed mean reactions for correct keystrokes in each condition of the Stimulus factor. These means were submitted to a one-factor repeated-measures ANOVA, with Stimulus (Normal, Bigrams, and Random) as the sole factor. The effect of Stimulus was significant, F(2, 74) = 230.58, MSE = 2510.98, p &lt; 0.001. The mean reaction time was fastest in the Normal condition (M = 833 ms, SE = 24 ms), followed by the Bigram condition, (M = 924 ms, SE = 27 ms) and slowest in the Random Condition (M = 1078 ms, SE = 32 ms). Mean reaction times were significantly faster (M = 91 ms) in the Normal than Bigrams condition, t(37) = 12.14, p &lt; 0.001. And, mean reaction times were significantly faster (M = 152 ms) in the Bigrams than Random condition, t(37) = 14.21, p &lt; 0.01. There are other ways to write-up statistical results. These are just some example recipes. The important thing is to: Say what the numbers were that you are analyzing Say what the statistical test was Say the results of the statistical test Say what the patterns of means were Say what the follow-up tests were when you test differences between specific means. Add a table or figure so it is easier to “see” the results. 9.4.9 Generalization Exercise Your task is to conduct another repeated-measures ANOVA. Rather than using the reaction time for the first-keystroke as the dependent measure, you will use the reaction times between all of the keystrokes in each word, these are called interkeystroke intervals. The Order variable is used to code keystroke position (1 to 5). You will want to analyze only the PureRTs that have an Order greater than 1. For example, you could use the following code to get the subject_means for the mean interkeystroke intervals. subject_means &lt;- all_data %&gt;% filter(Order &gt; 1, Correct==1, PureRTs&lt;5000) %&gt;% group_by(Subject, Stimulus) %&gt;% summarise(mean_rt = mean(PureRTs)) A. Make a figure for the new DV B. Report the ANOVA table for the new repeated measures ANOVA C. Discuss whether the general pattern is the same as before. 9.4.10 Writing assignment (2 points - Graded) Explain the concept of \\(SS_\\text{Total}\\) (.5 points) Explain the concept of partitioning SS_ into smaller pieces. What is the goal of the spitting? (.5 points) Explain the major difference between a between-subjects ANOVA and repeated-measures ANOVA in terms of what is being partioned. (1 point) General grading.

The independent variable was typing material and it had 3 levels: Normal (5 letter English words), Bigrams (5 letter non-words that have properties like real words), and Random (random 5 letter strings). The authors wanted to know whether reaction time (RT) was different according to the type of word being typed. Dependent Variables: There were three dependent variables, that all measured different aspects of typing performance. Reaction times (RTs) were defined as the temporal interval between seeing a stimulus (to type), and then starting to type it (first key press). Inter-keystroke intervals (IKSIs) are the times between each key-press. Last, accuracy was also measured (correct or incorrect key-presses). For this analysis we will use Pure RTs as our one DV. Nota bene: This is a repeated measures design because each participant typed letter strings from the word, bigrams, and random conditions. 9.6.2 Produce a frequency histogram and remove outliers Here is a link to the data file. It is named BehmerCrump.sav. Your data should look like this: First, we’ll be creating a histogram to look at our data. Go to Graphs, then Legacy Dialogs, then Histogram… The next window will ask you to specify the variable you would like graphed. Choose PureRTs from the list on the left and move it into the “Variable” field using the arrow. Click OK. SPSS will produce a frequency histogram of your data. Notice that the RTs form a positively skewed distribution. Most RT measurements are on the lower end of the scale, and there are very few RTs that are higher than 5000ms. These measurements could have resulted from subjects falling asleep, looking at their phones, or being otherwise distracted in the middle of the experiment. We want to remove those values so they do not influence and mischaracterize our results. To do this, go to the top menu and choose Data, then Select Cases… The next window will ask you which cases to select. We specifically want to remove any cases larger than 5000, so check off If condition is satisfied: Then click If… The window that follows will ask you to specify the condition for inclusion. Find the variable PureRTs in the left-hand list and move it to the field on top using the arrow. Then, type “&lt; 5000” to specify that we want to keep only values under 5000ms. Click Continue. Your data has now been edited so that trials on which the PureRTs value was greater than 5000 have been removed. Let’s take some time to think about this data. We have measurements taken from many participants across multiple trials and multiple conditions. Our goal is to be able to come up with a single RT for each person per condition. The only way to do this is to take an individual’s RTs for a particular condition and average them. To do this, we need to calculate means. First, go to Analyze, then Compare Means, then Means… In the next window, move the PureRTs variable into the “Dependent List” field. In the field below, labeled “Independent List”, place the Subject variable: Then, click Next. The bottom field will become blank again, and you can now place the Stimulus variable into it. Click OK. SPSS will produce an output table containing each subject’s average RT per condition: 9.6.3 Conduct and graph One-Factor Repeated Measures ANOVA For this part of the tutorial, we will switch over to a new SPSS file. Here is the link; it’s called BehmerCrumpMeanRTs.sav. When you open the file, it should look like this: Notice that this file contains the means from the table we just created. Each person’s data is contained within a row: there are 3 measurements corresponding to all stimulus conditions. To calculate a One-Factor Repeated Measures ANOVA, go to Analyze, then General Linear Model, then Repeated Measures… The next window will ask you to label your within-subjects variable. Type Stimulus into the “Within-Subjects Factor Name” field. Indicate that this variable has 3 levels. Then click Add, and then Define. In the next window, move all 3 conditions listed on the left into the “Within-Subjects Variables” field. Click OK. SPSS will produce an output table labeled “Tests of Within-SUbjects Effects” that contains The F statistic and its corresponding p-value. From this table, we see that there is a significant effect of stimulus on RT, F(2, 74)= 420.33, p&lt;.05. In order to graph this data and look at the means, go to Graphs, then Legacy Dialogs, then Bar… In the next window, choose Simple, but this time select Summaries of separate variables, then Define: In the next window, move the three stimulus conditions listed in the field on the left into the field labeled “Bars Represent.” Then click OK. SPSS will produce a bar graph with each bar representing the mean of each of the conditions. We can see that the Random condition has the longest RT, followed by Bigrams, and then Normal. However, at this point we do not know which groups are significantly different from the others. 9.6.4 Conduct planned comparisons using a paired-samples t-test To find out where the difference among these 3 conditions exists, we will use a planned comparison in the form of a paired-samples t-test. This method takes 2 groups at a time and tests for pairwise differences. There are three comparisons that can be made here: normal vs. bigram bigram vs. random random vs. normal We will use a paired-samples t-test instead of an independent-samples t-test because in each comparison, the same people are being remeasured in each group. To begin, go to Analyze, then Compare Means, then Paired Samples T-test… In the next window, move the two conditions of our first pairwise comparison (normal vs. bigram) into the field on the right using the arrow. Click OK. SPSS will produce a series of tables. The “Paired Samples test” table contains the t-statistic and its associated p-value. Looking at this output, we can see that the Normal and Bigrams conditions are indeed significantly different, t(37)= 13.09, p&lt;.05. You can use this same method for the remaining comparisons. 9.6.5 Practice Problems Run the same analysis as illustrated in this lab tutorial but with accuracy (correct) as the dependent variable. Use an alpha level of .05. Remember to calculate means per subject and stimulus first. This will generate a table, whose values you can enter into a new SPSS spreadsheet file. Is there an effect of stimulus on error rate? If so, conduct the appropriate planned comparisons. Graph the means using a bar graph; include +/-1 SEM Error bars. 9.7 JAMOVI How to do it in JAMOVI "],

It’s never simple to keep things simple. Simple solutions require the most advanced thinking. —Richie Norton 10.1 Does standing up make you focus more? This lab activity uses the data from “Stand by your Stroop: Standing up enhances selective attention and cognitive control” (Rosenbaum, Mama, Algom, 2017) to teach the analysis of a 2x2 design using ANOVA. Although the research design is a 2x2 repeated meaures design, we treat the design both as repeated measures, and as a between-subjects design to illustrate how to conduct either type of ANOVA in software. 10.1.1 STUDY DESCRIPTION Do you pay more attention when you are sitting or standing? We analyse the data from “Stand by your Stroop: Standing up enhances selective attention and cognitive control” (Rosenbaum, Mama, Algom, 2017). This paper asked whether sitting versus standing would influence a measure of selective attention, the ability to ignore distracting information. They used a classic test of selective attention, called the Stroop effect. In a typical Stroop experiment, subjects name the color of words as fast as they can. The trick is that sometimes the color of the word is the same as the name of the word, and sometimes it is not. Here are some examples: Congruent trials occur when the color and word match. So, the correct answers for each of the congruent stimuli shown would be to say, red, green, blue and yello. Incongruent trials occur when the color and word mismatch. The correct answers for each of the incongruent stimuli would be: blue, yellow, red, green. The Stroop effect is an example of a well-known phenomena. What happens is that people are faster to name the color of the congruent items compared to the color of the incongruent items. This difference (incongruent reaction time - congruent reaction time) is called the Stroop effect. Many researchers argue that the Stroop effect measures something about selective attention, the ability to ignore distracting information. In this case, the target information that you need to pay attention to is the color, not the word. For each item, the word is potentially distracting, it is not information that you are supposed to respond to. However, it seems that most people can’t help but notice the word, and their performance in the color-naming task is subsequently influenced by the presence of the distracting word. People who are good at ignoring the distracting words should have small Stroop effects. They will ignore the word, and it won’t influence them very much for either congruent or incongruent trials. As a result, the difference in performance (the Stroop effect) should be fairly small (if you have “good” selective attention in this task). People who are bad at ignoring the distracting words should have big Stroop effects. They will not ignore the words, causing them to be relatively fast when the word helps, and relatively slow when the word mismatches. As a result, they will show a difference in performance between the incongruent and congruent conditions. If we take the size of the Stroop effect as a measure of selective attention, we can then start wondering what sorts of things improve selective attention (e.g., that make the Stroop effect smaller), and what kinds of things impair selective attention (e.g., make the Stroop effect bigger). The research question of this study was to ask whether standing up improves selective attention compared to sitting down. They predicted smaller Stroop effects when people were standing up and doing the task, compared to when they were sitting down and doing the task. 10.1.2 Study Methods The design of the study was a 2x2 repeated-measures design. The first IV was congruency (congruent vs incongruent). The second IV was posture (sitting vs. standing). The DV was reaction time to name the word. There were 50 participants in the study. 10.2 Lab Skills Learned Conducting a 2x2 between-subjects ANOVA Conducting a 2x2 repeated-measures ANOVA 10.3 Important Stuff citation: Rosenbaum, D., Mama, Y., &amp; Algom, D.

What we want at the end of this conversion is: A column for the subject variable A column for the congruency variable A column for the posture (sit vs. stand) variable A column for the DV ( mean reaction times) We look at two ways to do the transformation from wide to long. The first way is to “do it by hand”, which refers to creating every variable individually, and then putting them together in a single data frame. This next bit of code does this, and you can check out stroop_df to see the result. RTs &lt;- c(as.numeric(unlist(all_data[,1])), as.numeric(unlist(all_data[,2])), as.numeric(unlist(all_data[,3])), as.numeric(unlist(all_data[,4])) ) Congruency &lt;- rep(rep(c(&quot;Congruent&quot;,&quot;Incongruent&quot;),each=50),2) Posture &lt;- rep(c(&quot;Stand&quot;,&quot;Sit&quot;),each=100) Subject &lt;- rep(1:50,4) stroop_df &lt;- data.frame(Subject,Congruency,Posture,RTs) Another way to transform between long and wide is to use R functions that were designed to do this job. For example there are the spread and gather functions from the tidyr package, and the melt and cast functions, which also do some data frame transforming. The transformation from wide to long can be complicated depending on the structure of the data, and you may often find it helpful to google these functions to look for more examples of their use. Let’s use the tidyr gather function to change our data from wide to long library(tidyr) stroop_long&lt;- gather(all_data, key=Condition, value=RTs, congruent_stand, incongruent_stand, congruent_sit, incongruent_sit) Take a moment to look at stroop_long. It is almost what we need. It is certainly in long format. There is a column for Subjects, and a column for the RTs, but there is only one column for both IVs, that’s no good. There are two IVs, we need two columns. Fortunately, the levels in the new Condition column are coded with a specific and consistent structure: congruent_stand incongruent_stand congruent_sit incongruent_sit If only we could split these by the “_&quot; (underscore), then we would have two columns for the congruency and the posture variable. We can do this using tstrsplit from the data.table package new_columns &lt;- tstrsplit(stroop_long$Condition, &quot;_&quot;, names=c(&quot;Congruency&quot;,&quot;Posture&quot;)) You can look inside new_columns to see that we succesfully made the split. Now, we just need to add them on to the stroop_long data frame. stroop_long &lt;- cbind(stroop_long,new_columns) Look at the stroop_long data frame and you will find that we have added two new columns, one that codes for Congruency, and the other that codes for posture. Using this method we still haven’t added a column for subjects. We can do that like this: stroop_long &lt;- cbind(stroop_long,Subject=rep(1:50,4)) 10.4.4.1 The independent variables After all of this data transformation you should be familiar with the IVs. Congruency: congruent vs. incongruent Posture: stand vs. sit 10.4.4.2 The dependent variables There is only one DV that we look at, that is the mean reaction time to name the color. 10.4.5 Look at the data Remember before we do any analysis, we always want to “look” at the data. This first pass let’s us know if the data “look right”. For example, the data file could be messed up and maybe there aren’t any numbers there, or maybe the numbers are just too weird. Let’s make a quick histogram of all of the RT data, like this: hist(stroop_long$RTs) This looks pretty good, there are no super huge numbers here. 10.4.6 Look at the means As part of looking at the data, we might as well make a figure that shows the mean reaction times in each condition, and some error bars to look at the spread in each condition. The following code takes two important steps: Get the means for each condition, by averaging over the means for each subject. These are put into the data frame called plot_means. Make a graph with the plot_means data frame using ggplot2. library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) plot_means &lt;- stroop_long %&gt;% group_by(Congruency,Posture) %&gt;% summarise(mean_RT = mean(RTs), SEM = sd(RTs)/sqrt(length(RTs))) ggplot(plot_means, aes(x=Posture, y=mean_RT, group=Congruency, fill=Congruency))+ geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, position=&quot;dodge&quot;)+ geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean_RT-SEM, ymax=mean_RT+SEM), position=position_dodge(width=0.9), width=.2)+ theme_classic()+ coord_cartesian(ylim=c(700,1000)) 10.4.7 Conduct the ANOVA In this lab we will show you how to conduct ANOVAs for factorial designs that are for: fully between-subjects designs (both IVs are between-subjects IVs) fully repeated measures designs (both IVs are repeated measures) The data we are looking at right now is fully repeated measures. However, in this lab we are first going to pretend that the experiment was not repeated measures. We are going to pretend it was fully between-subjects. Then we are going to conduct a between-subjects ANOVA. After that, we will conduct a repeated-measures ANOVA, which is what would be most appropriate for this data set. The overall point is to show you how to both of them, and the discuss how to interpret them and write them both up. 10.4.8 Between Subjects ANOVA We can always conduct a between-subjects version of the ANOVA on repeated-measures data if we wanted to. In this case we wouldn’t really want to do this. But, we will do this for educational purposes to show you how to do it in R. The syntax is very similar to what we do for one-way ANOVAs, remember the syntax was: aov(DV ~ IV, dataframe) If you want to add another IV, all you need to do is insert another one into the formula, like this: aov(DV ~ IV1*IV2, dataframe) Just, switch DV to the name of your dependent measure, and IV1 and IV2 to the names of your independent variables. Finally, put the name of your dataframe. Your dataframe must be in long format with one observation of the DV per row. Our formula will look like this: aov(RTs ~ Congruency*Posture, stroop_long) In plain language, this formula means, analyze RTs by the Congruency and Posture Variables. R will automatically produce the main effects for Congruency and Posture, as well as the interaction (Congruency X Posture). Also, remember, that in the following code, we use a few other functions so that we can print out the results nicely. library(xtable) aov_out&lt;-aov(RTs ~ Congruency*Posture, stroop_long) summary_out&lt;-summary(aov_out) library(xtable) knitr::kable(xtable(summary_out)) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) Congruency 1 576821.635 576821.635 43.7344419 0.0000000 Posture 1 32303.453 32303.453 2.4492381 0.1191950 Congruency:Posture 1 6560.339 6560.339 0.4974029 0.4814808 Residuals 196 2585080.215 13189.185 NA NA We can also have R print out the Grand Mean, the means for each level of each main effect, and the means for the interaction term. This is the same print out you would get in the console for R. It is admittedly not very pretty. There’s probably a way to make the means provided by model.tables() more pretty. If we find a way we will update this section, if you find a way, please let us know. print(model.tables(aov_out,&quot;means&quot;), format=&quot;markdown&quot;) ## Tables of means ## Grand mean ## ## 868.6454 ## ## Congruency ## Congruency ## congruent incongruent ## 814.9 922.3 ## ## Posture ## Posture ## sit stand ## 881.4 855.9 ## ## Congruency:Posture ## Posture ## Congruency sit stand ## congruent 821.9 808.0 ## incongruent 940.8 903.9 10.4.8.1 ANOVA write-up Here are the steps for writing up the results of an ANOVA: Say what means you analyzed Say what test you performed Say the inferential statisic for each of the effects (main effects and interaction) Say the pattern of results for each effect. A short example of the whole write-up is below: Example write-up We submitted the mean reaction times for each group to a 2 (Congruency: congrueny vs. incongruent) x 2 (Posture: Standing vs. Sitting) between-subjects ANOVA. There was a main effect of Congruency, F (1, 196) = 43.73, MSE = 13189.185, p &lt; 0.001. Mean reaction times were slower for incongruent (922 ms) than congruent groups (815 ms). There main effect of Posture was not significant, F (1, 196) = 2.45, MSE = 13189.185, p =.119. Mean reaction times were slower for sitting (881 ms) than standing groups (855 ms). The two-way interaction between Congruency and Posture was not significant, F (1, 196) = .497, MSE = 13189.185, p &lt; 0.481. For every F-value, we report F (df1, df2) = F-value, MSE = MSE for the error term, and p = x.xxx. In R, the df1, for the df in the numerator is always listed beside the name for a particular effect. For example, Congruency has 1 degree of freedom (there are two condition, and 2-1 =1). Similarly, the relevant F and p-value are listed in the same row as the effect of interest. However, the error term used to calculate the F-value is listed at the bottom, in R this is called “Residuals”. Df2, the df for the denominator is listed beside “Residuals”, in our case it was 196. The important bit is the MSE, which was 13189.185. Notice, that in the write up for each main effect and interaction we always reported the same MSE. That’s because in this between-subjects version of the ANOVA, we divide by same very same error term. Also notice that we don’t report the sums of squares of the MSE for the effect. Why not? The main reason why not is that you can reconstruct those missing numbers just by knowing the dfs, the MSE for the error, and the f-value. For example, you can get the MSE for the effect by multiplying the F-value by the MSE for the error. Now you have both MSEs. You can get both Sums of Squares by multiplying by their associated dfs. That’s just working backwards from the F-value. You can always check if you are reporting the correct MSE for the error term. If the MSE for your effect (numerator) divided by the MSE you are using for the error term does not equal the F-value, then you must be using the wrong terms! 10.4.9 Repeated measures ANOVA Of course, the design for this experiment was not between-subjects, it was fully within-subjects. Every participant completed both congruent and incongruent trials, while they were standing or sitting. For this reason, we should conduct a repeated measures ANOVA. This way we will be able capitilize on the major benefit provided by the repeated measures design. We can remove the variance due to individual subjects from the error terms we use to calculate F-values for each main effect and interaction. Rember the formula for the one-factor repeated-measures ANOVA, we’ll remind you: aov( DV ~ IV + Error(Subject/IV), dataframe) To do the same for a design with more than one IV we put in another IV to the formula, like this: aov( DV ~ IV1*IV2 + Error( Subject/(IV1*IV2) ), dataframe) DV = name of dependent variable IV1 = name of first independent variable IV2 = name of second indpendent variable Subject = name of the subject variable, coding the means for each subject in each condition dataframe = name of the long-format data frame Here is what our formula will look like: aov(RTs ~ Congruency*Posture + Error(Subject/(Congruency*Posture)), stroop_long) The main thing you need to watch out for when running this analysis in R, is that all your factors need to be factors in R. Often times people will use numbers rather than words or letters to code the levels for specific factors. This can be very often done for the subjects factor, using number 1 for subject one, and number 2 for subject 2. If you want your column variable to be treated as a factor, then you may need to convert it to a factor. We do this below for the Subject variable, which happens to be coded as numbers. If we do not do this, the repeated-measures ANOVA will return incorrect results. For example, if you look at the stroop_long data frame, and click the little circle with an arrow on in it in the environment panel, you should see that Subject is an int. That stands for integer. You should also see that Congruency and Posture are Factor, that’s good. We need to turn Subject into Factor. stroop_long$Subject &lt;- as.factor(stroop_long$Subject) #convert subject to factor summary_out&lt;-aov(RTs ~ Congruency*Posture + Error(Subject/(Congruency*Posture)), stroop_long) library(xtable) knitr::kable(xtable(summary_out)) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) Residuals 49 2250738.636 45933.4416 NA NA Congruency 1 576821.635 576821.6349 342.452244 0.0000000 Residuals 49 82534.895 1684.3856 NA NA Posture 1 32303.453 32303.4534 7.329876 0.0093104 Residuals1 49 215947.614 4407.0942 NA NA Congruency:Posture 1 6560.339 6560.3389 8.964444 0.0043060 Residuals 49 35859.069 731.8177 NA NA print(model.tables(aov_out,&quot;means&quot;), format=&quot;markdown&quot;) ## Tables of means ## Grand mean ## ## 868.6454 ## ## Congruency ## Congruency ## congruent incongruent ## 814.9 922.3 ## ## Posture ## Posture ## sit stand ## 881.4 855.9 ## ## Congruency:Posture ## Posture ## Congruency sit stand ## congruent 821.9 808.0 ## incongruent 940.8 903.9 What’s different here? Are any of the means different now that we have conducted a repeated-meaures version of the ANOVA, instead of the between-subjects ANOVA? NO! The grand mean is still the grand mean. The means for the congruency conditions are still the same, the means for the Posture conditions are still the same, and the means for the interaction effect are still the same. The only thing that has changed is the ANOVA table. Now that we have removed the variance associated with individual subjects, our F-values are different, and so are the-pvalues. Using an alpha of 0.05, all of the effects are “statistically significant”. Each main effect and the one interaction all have their own error term. In the table below, R lists each effect in one row, and then immediately below lists the error term for that effect. 10.4.9.1 ANOVA write-up Here is what a write-up would look like. Example write-up We submitted the mean reaction times for each subject in each condition to a 2 (Congruency: congrueny vs. incongruent) x 2 (Posture: Standing vs. Sitting) repeated measures ANOVA. There was a main effect of Congruency, F (1, 49) = 342.45, MSE = 1684.39, p &lt; 0.001. Mean reaction times were slower for incongruent (922 ms) than congruent groups (815 ms). There main effect of Posture was significant, F (1, 49) = 7.33, MSE = 4407.09, p =.009. Mean reaction times were slower for sitting (881 ms) than standing groups (855 ms). The two-way interaction between Congruency and Posture was significant, F (1, 49) = 8.96, MSE = 731.82, p &lt; 0.004. The Stroop effect was 23 ms smaller in the standing than sitting conditions. 10.4.10 Follow-up comparisons In a 2x2 ANOVA there are some follow-up comparisons you may be interested in making that are not done for you with the ANOVA. If an IV only have 2 levels, then you do not have to do any follow-up tests for the main effects of those IVs (that’s what the main effect from the ANOVA tells you). So, we don’t have to do follow-up comparisons for the main effects of congruency or posture. What about the interaction? Notice the interaction is composed of four means. The mean RT for congruent and incongruent for both sitting and standing. Also notice that we only got one F-value and one p-value from the ANOVA for the interaction term. So, what comparison was the ANOVA making? And what comparisons was it not making? It has already made one comparison, so you do not need a follow-up test for that…which one is it? If you remember back to the textbook, we should you how to analyze a 2x2 design with paired-samples t-tests. We analyzed the interaction term as the comparison of difference scores. Here, we would find the differences scores between incongruent and congruent for each level of the posture variable. In other words, we compute the Stroop effect for each subjet when they were sitting and standing, then compare the two Stroop effects. This comparison is looking at the difference between two differences scores, and that is the comparison that the ANOVA does for the interaction. To be more precise the comparison is: \\((sit:incongruent - sit:congruent) - (stand:incongruent - stand:congruent)\\) What comparisons are not made, what are the other ones we could do? Here are some: sit:congruent vs sit:incongruent stand:congruent vs stand:incongruent sit:congruent vs stand:incongruent stand:congruent vs sit:incongruent We could add a few more. These kinds of comparisons are often called simple effects, apparently referring to the fact they are just comparing means in a straight forward way. There are a few different comparisons we could do. Should we do any of them? Whether or not you compare means usually depends on the research question you are asking. Some comparisons make sense within context of the research question, and others may not. We will do two follow-up comparisons. Our question will be about the size of the Stroop effect in the Sitting and Standing conditions. We already know that the size of the effect was smaller in the Standing condition. But, we don’t know if it got so small that it went away (at least statistically speaking). Now, we can ask: Was the Stroop effect only for the sitting condition statistically signficant. In other words, was the difference in mean RT between the incongruent and congruent conditions unlikely under the null (or unlikely to be produced by chance) Was the Stroop effect only for the standing condition statistically signficant. In other words, was the difference in mean RT between the incongruent and congruent conditions unlikely under the null (or unlikely to be produced by chance) We can answer both of the questions using paired sample t-tests comparing the means in question 10.4.10.1 Sitting Stroop means_to_compare &lt;- stroop_long %&gt;% filter(Posture==&quot;sit&quot;) t.test(RTs~Congruency, paired=TRUE, var.equal=TRUE, data=means_to_compare) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: RTs by Congruency ## t = -16.516, df = 49, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -133.3250 -104.3997 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## -118.8623 10.4.10.2 Standing Stroop means_to_compare &lt;- stroop_long %&gt;% filter(Posture==&quot;stand&quot;) t.test(RTs~Congruency, paired=TRUE, var.equal=TRUE, data=means_to_compare) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: RTs by Congruency ## t = -14.327, df = 49, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -109.41185 -82.49462 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## -95.95323 10.4.11 Generalization Exercise Here are some means for four conditions in a 2x2 Design: IV1 Level 1 Level 2 IV 2 Level 1 100 200 Level 2 200 500 Your task is to: A. Compute the mean difference for the main effect of IV1 B. Compute the mean difference for the main effect of IV2 C.

Selective attention here is measured as performance on the Stroop task. In a typical Stroop experiment, subjects name the color of words as fast as they can. The trick is that sometimes the color of the word is the same as the name of the word, and sometimes it is not. The design of the study was a 2x2 design. The first IV was congruency (congruent vs incongruent). The second IV was posture (sitting vs. standing). The DV was reaction time (RT)to name the word. 10.6.2 Conduct a Between-Subjects Two-Factor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Here is a link to our data file. It is named stroopsit.sav. Your data should look like this: Notice that in this file, there are 200 rows (corresponding to 200 subjects). Each subject is categorized according to 2 independent variables: posture (whether they were in the standing or sitting condition), and congruency (whether the stimuli they received were congruent or incongruent). In this application, we are treating the design as between-subjects. This means each participant only experienced one of the following four conditions: congruent stand incongruent stand congruent sit incongruent sit Now, let’s run our Two-Factor ANOVA. Go to Analyze, then General Linear Model, then Univariate… A window will appear asking for you to specify your variables. Place RT into the “Dependent Variable” field, and put both “posture” and “congruency” into the “Fixed Factors” field. Now, before pressing anything else, click on Plots… (this will allow us to create a plot of means right along with our SPSS output). In the plots window, you must place the congruency and posture variables into the fields labeled “Horizontal Axis”&quot; and “Separate Lines”. You can place either variable in either field, and the graph will still make sense. However, for this example, I will be putting congruency into the “Separate Lines”&quot; field, and posture in “Horizontal Axis”: You must click Add for this table to be included in your SPSS output. After you do this, Your window should look like this: Then click Continue and OK. Your output will include a table labeled “Tests of Between Subjects Effects” and a plot of the means. You can see from this output that: There is no main effect of posture, F(1, 196)=2.449, p=NS There is a main effect of congruency, F(1, 196)=43.734, p&lt;.05 where (from looking at the plot) incongruent stimuli were processed with a longer reaction time than congruent stimuli. There is no interaction between posture and congruency, F(1, 196)=.497, p=NS 10.6.3 Calculate simple effects In previous ANOVAs, we have conducted both planned and unplanned comparisons to locate the significant differences. In the case of a two-factor ANOVA, there are many comparisons that can be made. However, the comparisons you choose will depend on the results of your ANOVA. In this case, we found only a significant main effect of congruency. So, we can explore this effect more by asking: For the sitting condition only, are congruent and incongruent means significantly different? For the standing condition only, are congruent and incongruent means significantly different? To answer these questions, we must calculate something called simple effects. They look at mean differences within levels of a single independent variable. In order to acheive this in SPSS, we have to get into the coding environment that runs the SPSS program; it’s called Syntax. Don’t freak out here, we’re going to make this as simple as possible. First, let’s go to the menu just as we did to run this ANOVA. Analyze, General Linear Model, then Univariate… The next window looks just as we left it, with the variables in the right places. Here, click on the button that says Paste. The result will be a new window with code already entered into it. This code correponds to the ANOVA setup we have specified. You are going to edit this code so that it looks like this: UNIANOVA RT BY posture congruency /METHOD=SSTYPE(3) /INTERCEPT=INCLUDE /PLOT=PROFILE(posture * congruency) /EMMEANS=TABLES(posture * congruency) COMPARE(congruency) ADJ(LSD) /CRITERIA=ALPHA(.05) /DESIGN=posture congruency posture * congruency. Once it does, click the big green triangle (“play”) at the top of the window. SPSS will produce a series of tables. The one that refers to simple effects is called “Pairwise Comparisons.” From this table, we can see that, In the sitting condition, the congruent and incongruent conditions are significantly different (p&lt;.05). In the standing condition, the congruent and incongruent conditions are significantly different (p&lt;.05). 10.6.4 Conduct a Repeated Measures Two-Factor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Next, we will use this same data but treat it as a repeated measures (within-subjects) design (just as in the original experiment). This means each person in the study experienced ALL 4 conditions. To start, we need a new data file. Here is link. This data file is called stroopsit_RM.sav. I have set it up so that the data is arranged for a repeated-measures design. Notice that each person is represented by a single row, and the columns correspond to the 4 conditions: Now, to run a repeated measures ANOVA, we go to Analyze, then General Linear Model, then Repeated Measures: The next window will ask for the name and number of levels of your within-subjects factors (variables); We have two within-subjects factors: posture and congruency, and each factor has two levels. We must enter then here one at a time. First, change the default factor1 name to congruency, and specify that it has 2 levels: Click Add, and then enter a new within-subjects factor, posture with 2 levels as well: Now, click Add, and then Define. The next window asks for the 4 conditions produced by our two independent variables. Because we entered posture first, and congruency next, the four conditions, in THIS EXACT order, are entered as follows: Click Plots and specify a graph exactly as we did in the previous example. Place posture in the “Separate Lines” field and congruency in the “Horizontal axis” field. Remember, you must click Add to process this graph! Now, click Continue, then OK. SPSS will produce several tables of output, along with a graph. The Fs for our ANOVA are located in the table labeled “Tests of Within-Subjects Effects”, and the plot we requested is found below: According to this output: 1. There is a main effect of congruency, F(1, 49)=342.45, p&lt;.05. 2. There is a main effect of posture, F(1, 49)=7.33, p&lt;.05. 3. There is an interaction effect between congruency and posture, F(1, 49)=8.96, p&lt;.05. From the plot we can see that incongruent words produced longer RTs than congruent words. We also see that sitting produced longer RTs than standing. As for the interaction, you can see that the difference between congruent and incongruent is more pronounced (larger) in the sitting condition than in the standing condition. 10.6.5 Calculate simple effects We may want to dissect these effects similarly to the way did in the previous example. This time, because all 3 effects were significant, we will ask SPSS to conduct simple effects for both congruency and posture. To begin, go to Analyze, General Linear Model, and Repeated Measures… In the next window, all of your saved settings are still there, so click Define. In the next window, click Paste: You will be taken to the SPSS Syntax window. Change the syntax you see to the following: GLM congruent_stand congruent_sit incongruent_stand incongruent_sit /WSFACTOR=congruency 2 Polynomial posture 2 Polynomial /METHOD=SSTYPE(3) /PLOT=PROFILE(congruency * posture) /EMMEANS=TABLES(congruency * posture) compare(congruency) adj(lsd) /EMMEANS=TABLES(congruency * posture) compare(posture) adj(lsd) /CRITERIA=ALPHA(.05) /WSDESIGN=congruency posture congruency * posture. Click the green triangle (“play”)at the top and you will see several output tables appear in the output window. We will focus on the following two: When reading these tables, remember that: For posture, 1=stand and 2=sit For congruency, 1=congruent and 2=incongruent. In this output, we can see that: 1. For standing only, congruent and incongruent RTs are significantly different (p&lt;.05). 2. For sitting only, congruent and incongruent RTs are significantly different (p&lt;.05). 3. For congruent words only, standing and sitting RTs are not significantly different (p=NS). 4.

People take pictures of things all the time on their phones. Barasch et al. (2017) asked whether taking pictures of things had consequences for later memory of those experiences. 11.1.1 Study description In Experiment 1, participants visited a museum exhibit. Half of the participants were allowed to take photographs (with camera, at least 10 pictures) and the other half were not (no camera). They freely looked at anything in the exhibit, and were allowed to take pictures of anything they wanted (if they were in the camera condition). Additionally, while visiting the exhibit, participants listened to audio guides about the things the were looking at. After participants were done with the exhibit the returned to the sign-in desk. At this point they were given two memory tests for the things they saw and heard in the exhibit. They were given a visual recognition test containing pictures of objects, and were asked to identify which objects they remembered seeing. They were also given an auditory recognition test containing statements that could have been on the audio guide, and they had to identify which ones they had heard before. This is a 2x2 mixed design. IV 1 was a between-subjects manipulation involving picture-taking (camera vs. no camera). IV2 was a within-subject manipulation of memory test (visual vs. audio). The dependent measure was performance on the memory test. An overarching question was whether or not participants would have better visual memory for exhibit objects when they took pictures, compared to when they didn’t. Additionally, taking pictures or not, may have no influence on memory for the statements in the audio guide. 11.2 Lab Skills Learned Conducting a 2x2 mixed design ANOVA 11.3 Important Stuff citation: Barasch, A., Diehl, K., Silverman, J., &amp; Zauberman, G.

Click the button to view it in your browser, then take a look to see what is in it. library(summarytools) view(dfSummary(all_data)) 11.4.3 Get the data you need This data file contains all of the data from Experiment 1 in the paper. 11.4.4 Get the data into the format you want The data is sort of in long-format, we will see that we need to do some transformation after looking more closely at the independent and dependent variables 11.4.4.1 The independent variables Photo vs. No photo is coded in the condition column Memory task (visual vs. audio). There are no column variables describing which memory task people performed. Instead, the percent correct for the visual memory task is coded in the vpercent column, and the percent correct for the audio memory task is coded in the apercent column. We will need to transform the data, we do that after describing the DV 11.4.4.2 The dependent variable In a sense there are two dependent variables, vpercent and apercent. However, we will treat them as a single memory performance variable. 11.4.4.3 Transforming the data There were 297 participants. You can check that we have data for each participant by looking at the labID column. length(unique(all_data$labID)) ## [1] 297 There are 297 rows of data, each corresponding to a single subject. Let’s build a data frame we can use for analysis subjects &lt;- as.factor(c(all_data$labID,all_data$labID)) memory_accuracy &lt;- c(all_data$vpercent,all_data$apercent) memory_task&lt;-as.factor(rep(c(&quot;visual&quot;,&quot;audio&quot;), each=297)) camera &lt;- as.factor(c(all_data$condition,all_data$condition)) new_data &lt;- data.frame(subjects, memory_accuracy, memory_task, camera) 11.4.5 Look at the data Remember before we do any analysis, we always want to “look” at the data. This first pass let’s us know if the data “look right”. For example, the data file could be messed up and maybe there aren’t any numbers there, or maybe the numbers are just too weird. For example, the memory performance DV is a percent, so it should range between 0 and 100, if we find numbers that are negative or greater than 100, then we know something is wrong. hist(new_data$memory_accuracy) range(new_data$memory_accuracy) ## [1] 11.11111 100.00000 Great, the numbers check out, they are all inside the range of 0 to 100. 11.4.6 Look at the means As part of looking at the data, let’s graph the means in each condition. Get the means for each condition, by averaging over the means for each subject. These are put into the data frame called plot_means. Make a graph with the plot_means data frame using ggplot2. library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) plot_means &lt;- new_data %&gt;% group_by(memory_task,camera) %&gt;% summarise(mean_accuracy = mean(memory_accuracy), SEM = sd(memory_accuracy)/sqrt(length(memory_accuracy))) ggplot(plot_means, aes(x=memory_task, y=mean_accuracy, group=camera, fill=camera))+ geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, position=&quot;dodge&quot;)+ geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean_accuracy-SEM, ymax=mean_accuracy+SEM), position=position_dodge(width=0.9), width=.2)+ theme_classic()+ coord_cartesian(ylim=c(50,100)) 11.4.7 Conduct the ANOVA This is a 2x2 mixed design. So, we need to run a mixed design ANOVA. The formula for running a mixed design ANOVA is very similar what we have seen before. The only difference is that we specify which IV is within-subjects by placing it in the error term: aov(DV ~ IVB * IVW + Error(Subjects/IVW, data) library(xtable) aov_out&lt;-aov(memory_accuracy ~ camera*memory_task + Error(subjects/memory_task), new_data) summary_out&lt;-summary(aov_out) knitr::kable(xtable(summary_out)) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) camera 1 641.9545 641.9545 2.26222 0.1336337 Residuals 295 83712.7032 283.7719 NA NA memory_task 1 26786.5902 26786.5902 108.84808 0.0000000 camera:memory_task 1 3394.1862 3394.1862 13.79237 0.0002441 Residuals 295 72597.0014 246.0915 NA NA Let’s also print out the means for the main effects and interaction: print(model.tables(aov_out,&quot;means&quot;), format=&quot;markdown&quot;) ## Tables of means ## Grand mean ## ## 69.86532 ## ## camera ## nophoto photo ## 68.83 70.91 ## rep 298.00 296.00 ## ## memory_task ## audio visual ## 76.58 63.15 ## rep 297.00 297.00 ## ## camera:memory_task ## memory_task ## camera audio visual ## nophoto 77.93 59.73 ## rep 149.00 149.00 ## photo 75.23 66.59 ## rep 148.00 148.00 11.4.8 Generalization Exercise The generalization exercise is the writing assignment for this lab. 11.4.9 Writing assignment Your writing assignment is to write up the results of the ANOVA that you just conducted. You can follow the general recipe from the ANOVA write-up from the previous lab on factorial designs. Your write up will be in two parts (3 points total) Part 1 Say what the numbers were that you are analyzing Say what the statistical test was Say the results of the statistical test for each main effect and interaction For each effect, say what the patterns of the means were. Part 2 Conduct follow-up t-tests. A. Determine whether memory accuracy is better in the camera vs no camera condition for the visual memory task. Report the t-test and the pattern of means. B. Determine whether memory accuracy is better in the camera vs. no camera condition for the audio memory task. Report the t-test and the pattern of means. 11.5 Excel How to do it in Excel 11.6 SPSS In this lab, we will use SPSS to: Conduct and graph a Mixed-Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Calculate simple effects 11.6.1 Experiment Background People take pictures of things all the time on their phones. Barasch et al. (2017) asked whether taking pictures of things had consequences for later memory of those experiences. In this experiment participants visited a museum exhibit. Half the participants were able to use a camera to document their visit, while the other half were not, all while listening to an audio tour of the exhibit. At the end of the visit, everyone was given two memory tests (visual and audio) for the content they saw and heard, respectively. This is a 2x2 Mixed-Factorial design. The individuals in the photo group are different than the individuals in the no photo group (this is our between-subjects variable–it is called condition), while the memory test_type (audio and visual) is our within-subjects variable since everyone took both types of tests. 11.6.2 Conduct a Mixed-Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Using SPSS, open the data file linked here. It is called “study1_data_photo.sav”. It should look like this: Scroll through the file. Find the variable named condition. This variable tells you if the row in question corresponds to a person who was or was not able to use a camera. Now, find the variables apercent and vpercent. These variables refer to the percentage score received by everyone on the audio and visual memory tests, respectively. Notice that every row in the data file only has ONE “condition” label. That is, you were either in the camera or no camera condition. BUT, everyone in the file has scores for BOTH tests, audio and visual. This is the way your data must be structed in SPSS in order to perform a mixed-factorial ANOVA. Now, let’s begin. Go to the top menu and choose Analyze, General Linear Model , and Repeated Measures… The next window will ask for you to specify the Within-Subjects variable ONLY. Our within-subjects variable (the variable for which participants were measured across all levels) was the memory test_type. Enter test_type into this field, and specify that there are 2 levels. You must click Add in order to continue: Then click Define. The next window will ask you to specify the levels of your within-subjects variable. Place apercent and vpercent from the list on the left into the field labeled “Within-Subjects Variables”. Then, place condition into the field labeled “Between-Subjects variables”. Now, click Plots. Place condition in the “Separate Lines” field and test_type in the “Horizontal axis” field: Then click Add. Your window will look like this once you’ve done that: Now, click Continue and then OK. SPSS will produce output tables for your ANOVA, as well as a plot: Let’s look at our output tables. Based on its values, we can tell that: There is a significant main effect of test type, F(1, 295)=108.59, p&lt;.05. Overall, memory test scores were higher for the audio test than the video test. There is a significant ineraction effect between test type and condition, F(1, 295)=13.79, p&lt;.05. People taking photos did worse on the audio test than people without photos, however, on the visual test, people taking photos did better than those who did not take photos. There is no significant main effect of condition, F(1, 295)=2.26, p=NS. 11.6.3 Calculate simple effects What if we asked the questions: 1. In the no photo condition only, was there a difference between audio and visual memory score? 2. In the photo condition only, was there a difference between audio and visual memory score? 3. Were audio memory test scores different between photo and no photo conditions? 4. Were visual memory test scores different between photo and no photo conditions? To answer these questions, we must run simple effects. If you remember from earlier labs, we must use SPSS syntax to do this. Go to Analyze, then General Linear Model, then Repeated Measures… In the next window, you’ll find your settings from the previously-run ANOVA have been saved. Click Define. The following window will appear: Click Paste and the SPSS Syntax Editor will appear: Change the code on the screen to the following: GLM apercent vpercent BY condition /WSFACTOR=test_type 2 Polynomial /METHOD=SSTYPE(3) /EMMEANS=TABLES(test_type * condition) compare(test_type) adj(lsd) /EMMEANS=TABLES(test_type * condition) compare(condition) adj(lsd) /CRITERIA=ALPHA(.05) /WSDESIGN=test_type /DESIGN=condition. Click the green triangle (“play”) at the top of the window. The following two tables will appear (among others) in your output window: Keep in mind that for test_type, 1=audio and 2=visual . According to the table, we can see that: In the no photo condition only, there was a significant difference between audio and visual memory (p&lt;.05)? In the photo condition only, there was a significant difference between audio and visual memory (p&lt;.05)? Audio memory test scores in the photo condition were not significantly different from those in the no photo condition (p=NS). Visual memory test scores in the photo condition were significantly different from those in the no photo condition (p&lt;.05). 11.6.4 Practice Problems Using the same data file we used for this lab’s tutorial, run a Mixed-Factorial ANOVA using test type (audio and visual) and Gender (Male, Female). Use an alpha level of .05. Report your results in standard statistical reporting format. Produce a plot of means. 11.7 JAMOVI How to do it in JAMOVI "],

Too many. Sometimes so many your head explodes just thinking about them. One of the most helpful things you can do to begin to make sense of these numbers, is to look at them in graphical form. Unfortunately, for sight-impaired individuals, graphical summary of data is much more well-developed than other forms of summarizing data for our human senses. Some researchers are developing auditory versions of visual graphs, a process called sonification, but we aren’t prepared to demonstrate that here. Instead, we will make charts, and plots, and things to look at, rather than the numbers themselves, mainly because these are tools that are easiest to get our hands on, they are the most developed, and they work really well for visual summary. If time permits, at some point I would like to come back here and do the same things with sonification. I think that would be really, really cool! 12.1 General Goals Our general goals for this first lab are to get your feet wet, so to speak. We’ll do these things: Load in some data to a statistical software program Talk a little bit about how the data is structured Make graphs of the data so we can look at it and make sense of it. 12.1.1 Important info Data for NYC film permits was obtained from the NYC open data website. The .csv file can be found here: Film_Permits.csv Gapminder data from the gapminder project (copied from the R gapminder library) can be downloaded in .csv format here: gapminder.csv 12.2 R 12.2.1 Download the lab templates You will be completing each lab by writing your code and notes in an R Markdown document. Download the RMarkdownsLab.zip to your computer. Unzip the file, this will produce a new folder with three important parts data folder (contains data files for all labs) LabTemplates folder (contains blank templates for completing all the labs) RMarkdownsLab.Rproj A file with a little blue cube with an R in it. Double-click the RMarkdownsLab.Rproj file, this will automatically open R-studio (if you are at home, you must install R and R-studio first, or you can use R-studio Cloud through your web-browser) Copy the template .Rmd file for lab 1 from the LabTemplates folder into the main folder, then open it, and use it to begin adding your code and notes for lab 1. Watch this screencast to help you get started. Your lab instructor will show you how to open R-studio on the lab computer. Just find it and double-click. Now you have R-studio. Your lab instructor will also walk you through the steps to get started completing the first lab. We also wrote down the steps here, and made a little movie. There are numerous resources for learning about R, we put some of them on the course website, under the resouces page. You will find these resources helpful as you learn. We also have a kind of general introduction to R and Rstudio here. This shows you how to download R and R-studio at home (it’s free). Throughout the labs you will be writing things called R Markdown documents. You will learn how to do this throughout the labs, but it can also be worthwhile reading other tutorials, such as the one provided by R Markdown. When we made this course, we assumed that most students would be unfamiliar with R and R-studio, and might even be frightened of it, because it is a computer programming language (OOOOHHH NOOOOOOO, I NEED TO DROP THIS COURSE NOW)…Don’t worry. It’s going to be way easier than you think. Let’s compare to other statistics courses where you would learn something like SPSS. That is also a limited programming language, but you would mostly learn how to point with a mouse, and click with button. I bet you already know how to do that. I bet you also already know how to copy and paste text, and press enter. That’s mostly what we’ll be doing to learn R. We will be doing statistics by typing commands, rather than by clicking buttons. However, lucky for you, all of the commands are already written for you. You just have to copy/paste them. We know that this will seem challenging at first. But, we think that with lots of working examples, you will get the hang of it, and by the end of the course you will be able to do things you might never have dreamed you can do. It’s really a fantastic skill to learn, even if you aren’t planning on going on to do research in Psychology (in which case, this kind of thing is necessary skill to learn). With that, let’s begin. 12.2.2 Get some data In order to graph data, we need to have some data first…Actually, with R, that’s not quite true. Run this bit of code and see what happens: hist(rnorm(100, mean=50, sd=25)) You just made R sample 100 numbers, and then plot the results in a histogram. Pretty neat. We’ll be doing some of this later in the course, where get R to make fake data for us, and then we learn to think about how data behaves under different kinds of assumptions. For now, let’s do something that might be a little bit more interesting…what movies are going to be filming in NYC? It turns out that NYC makes a lot of data about a lot things open and free for anyone to download and look at. This is the NYC Open Data website: https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us. I searched through the data, and found this data file that lists the locations of film permits for shooting movies all throughout the Burroughs. You can download the data to your computer from this link library(data.table) nyc_films &lt;-fread(&quot;data/Film_Permits.csv&quot;) 12.2.3 Look at the data You will be downloading and analyzing all kinds of data files this semester. We will follow the very same steps every time. The steps are to load the data, then look at it. You want to see what you’ve got. In R-studio, you will now see a variable called nyc_films in the top right-hand corner of the screen, in the environment tab. If you click this thing, it will show you the contents of the data in a new window. The data is stored in something we call a data frame. It’s R lingo, for the thing that contains the data. Notice is a square, with rows going across, and columns going up and down. It looks kind of like an excel spreadsheet if you are familiar with Excel. It’s useful to know you can look at the data frame this way if you need to. But, this data frame is really big, it has 50,728 rows of data. That’s a lot too much to look at. 12.2.3.1 summarytools The summarytools packages give a quick way to summarize all of the data in a data frame. Here’s how. When you run this code you will see the summary in the viewer on the bottom right hand side. There’s a little browser button (arrow on top of little window) that you can click to expand and see the whole thing in a browser. library(summarytools) view(dfSummary(nyc_films)) That is super helpful, but it’s still a lot to look at. Because there is so much data here, it’s pretty much mind-boggling to start thinking about what to do with it. 12.2.4 Make Plots to answer questions Let’s walk through a couple questions we might have about this data. We can see that there were 50,728 film permits made. We can also see that there are different columns telling us information about each of the film permits. For example, the Borough column lists the Borough for each request, whether it was made for: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queen’s, or Staten Island. Now we can ask our first question, and learn how to do some plotting in R. 12.2.4.1 Where are the most film permits being requested? Do you have any guesses? Is it Manhattan, or Brooklyn, of the Bronx? Or Queen’s or Staten Island? We can find out by plotting the data using a bar plot. We just need to count how many film permits are made in each borough, and then make different bars represent the the counts. First, we do the counting in R. Run the following code. library(dplyr) counts &lt;- nyc_films %&gt;% group_by(Borough) %&gt;% summarize(count_of_permits = length(Borough)) The above grouped the data by each of the five Borough’s, and then counted the number of times each Borough occurred (using the length function). The result is a new variable called count. I chose to name this variable count. You can see that it is now displayed in the top-right hand corned in the environment tab. If you gave count a different name, like muppets, then it would be named what you called it. If you click on the counts variable, you will see the five boroughs listed, along with the counts for how many film permits were requested in each Borough. These are the numbers that we want to plot in a graph. We do the plot using a fantastic package called ggplot2. It is very powerful once you get the hand of it, and when you do, you will be able to make all sorts of interesting graphs. Here’s the code to make the plot library(ggplot2) ggplot(counts, aes(x = Borough, y = count_of_permits )) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) There it is, we’re done here! We can easily look at this graph, and answer our question. Most of the film permits were requested in Manhattan, followed by Brooklyn, then Queen’s, the Bronx, and finally Staten Island. 12.2.4.2 What kind of “films” are being made, what is the category? We think you might be skeptical of what you are doing here, copying and pasting things. Soon you’ll see just how fast you can do things by copying and pasting, and make a few little changes. Let’s quickly ask another question about what kinds of films are being made. The column Category, gives us some information about that. Let’s just copy paste the code we already made, and see what kinds of categories the films fall into. See if you can tell what I changed in the code to make this work, I’ll do it all at once: counts &lt;- nyc_films %&gt;% group_by(Category) %&gt;% summarize(count_of_permits = length(Category)) ggplot(counts, aes(x = Category, y = count_of_permits )) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;)+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) OK, so this figure might look a bit weird because the labels on the bottom are running into each other. We’ll fix that in a bit. First, let’s notice the changes. I changed Borough to Category. That was the main thing I left out a bunch of things from before. None of the library() commands are used again, and I didn’t re-run the very early code to get the data. R already has those things in it’s memory, so we don’t need to do that first. If you ever clear the memory of R, then you will need to reload those things. First-things come first. Fine, so how do we fix the graph? Good question. To be honest, I don’t know right now. I totally forgot how. But, I know ggplot2 can do this, and I’m going to Google it, right now. Then I’m going to find the answer, and use it here. The googling of your questions is a fine way to learn. It’s what everybody does these days….[goes to Google…]. Found it, actually found a lot of ways to do this. The trick is to add the last line. I just copy-pasted it from the solution I found on stack overflow (you will become friend’s with stack overflow, there are many solutions there to all of your questions) counts &lt;- nyc_films %&gt;% group_by(Category) %&gt;% summarize(count_of_permits = length(Category)) ggplot(counts, aes(x = Category, y = count_of_permits )) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;)+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) 12.2.5 ggplot2 basics Before we go further, I want to point out some basic properties of ggplot2, just to give you a sense of how it is working. This will make more sense in a few weeks, so come back here to remind yourself. We’ll do just a bit a basics, and then move on to making more graphs, by copying and pasting. The ggplot function uses layers. Layers you say? What are these layers? Well, it draws things from the bottom up. It lays down one layer of graphics, then you can keep adding on top, drawing more things. So the idea is something like: Layer 1 + Layer 2 + Layer 3, and so on. If you want Layer 3 to be Layer 2, then you just switch them in the code. Here is a way of thinking about ggplot code ggplot(name_of_data, aes(x = name_of_x_variable, y = name_of_y_variable)) + geom_layer()+ geom_layer()+ geom_layer() What I want you to focus on in the above description is the \\(+\\) signs. What we are doing with the plus signs is adding layers to plot. The layers get added in the order that they are written. If you look back to our previous code, you will see we add a geom_bar layer, then we added another layer to change the rotation of the words on the x-axis. This is how it works. BUT WAIT? How am I supposed to know what to add? This is nuts! We know. You’re not supposed to know just yet, how could you? We’ll give you lots of examples where you can copy and paste, and they will work. That’s how you’ll learn. If you really want to read the help manual you can do that too. It’s on the ggplot2 website. This will become useful after you already know what you are doing, before that, it will probably just seem very confusing. However, it is pretty neat to look and see all of the different things you can do, it’s very powerful. For now, let’s the get the hang of adding things to the graph that let us change some stuff we might want to change. For example, how do you add a title? Or change the labels on the axes? Or add different colors, or change the font-size, or change the background? You can change all of these things by adding different lines to the existing code. 12.2.5.1 ylab() changes y label The last graph had count_of_permits as the label on the y-axis. That doesn’t look right. ggplot2 automatically took the label from the column, and made it be the name on the y-axis. We can change that by adding ylab(&quot;what we want&quot;). We do this by adding a \\(+\\) to the last line, then adding ylab() ggplot(counts, aes(x = Category, y = count_of_permits )) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + ylab(&quot;Number of Film Permits&quot;) 12.2.5.2 xlab() changes x label Let’s slightly modify the x label too: ggplot(counts, aes(x = Category, y = count_of_permits )) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + ylab(&quot;Number of Film Permits&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Category of film&quot;) 12.2.5.3 ggtitle() adds title Let’s give our graph a title ggplot(counts, aes(x = Category, y = count_of_permits )) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + ylab(&quot;Number of Film Permits&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Category of film&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Number of Film permits in NYC by Category&quot;) 12.2.5.4 color adds color Let’s make the bars different colors. To do this, we add new code to the inside of the aes() part: ggplot(counts, aes(x = Category, y = count_of_permits, color=Category )) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + ylab(&quot;Number of Film Permits&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Category of film&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Number of Film permits in NYC by Category&quot;) 12.2.5.5 fill fills in color Let’s make the bars different colors. To do this, we add new code to the inside of the aes() part…Notice I’ve started using new lines to make the code more readable. ggplot(counts, aes(x = Category, y = count_of_permits, color=Category, fill= Category )) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + ylab(&quot;Number of Film Permits&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Category of film&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Number of Film permits in NYC by Category&quot;) 12.2.5.6 get rid of the legend Sometimes you just don’t want the legend on the side, to remove it add theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;) ggplot(counts, aes(x = Category, y = count_of_permits, color=Category, fill= Category )) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + ylab(&quot;Number of Film Permits&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Category of film&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Number of Film permits in NYC by Category&quot;) + theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;) 12.2.5.7 theme_classic() makes white background The rest is often just visual preference. For example, the graph above has this grey grid behind the bars. For a clean classic no nonsense look, use theme_classic() to take away the grid. ggplot(counts, aes(x = Category, y = count_of_permits, color=Category, fill= Category )) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + ylab(&quot;Number of Film Permits&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Category of film&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Number of Film permits in NYC by Category&quot;) + theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;) + theme_classic() 12.2.5.8 Sometimes layer order matters Interesting, theme_classic() is misbehaving a little bit. It looks like we have some of our layer out of order, let’s re-order. I just moved theme_classic() to just underneath the geom_bar() line. Now everything get’s drawn properly. ggplot(counts, aes(x = Category, y = count_of_permits, color=Category, fill= Category )) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + theme_classic() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + ylab(&quot;Number of Film Permits&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Category of film&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Number of Film permits in NYC by Category&quot;) + theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;) 12.2.5.9 Font-size Changing font-size is often something you want to do. ggplot2 can do this in different ways. I suggest using the base_size option inside theme_classic(). You set one number for the largest font size in the graph, and everything else gets scaled to fit with that that first number. It’s really convenient. Look for the inside of theme_classic() ggplot(counts, aes(x = Category, y = count_of_permits, color=Category, fill= Category )) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + theme_classic(base_size = 15) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + ylab(&quot;Number of Film Permits&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Category of film&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Number of Film permits in NYC by Category&quot;) + theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;) or make things small… just to see what happens ggplot(counts, aes(x = Category, y = count_of_permits, color=Category, fill= Category )) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + theme_classic(base_size = 10) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + ylab(&quot;Number of Film Permits&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Category of film&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Number of Film permits in NYC by Category&quot;) + theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;) 12.2.5.10 ggplot2 summary That’s enough of the ggplot2 basics for now. You will discover that many things are possible with ggplot2. It is amazing. We are going to get back to answering some questions about the data with graphs. But, now that we have built the code to make the graphs, all we need to do is copy-paste, and make a few small changes, and boom, we have our graph. 12.2.6 More questions about NYC films 12.2.6.1 What are the sub-categories of films? Notice the nyc_films data frame also has a column for SubCategoryName. Let’s see what’s going on there with a quick plot. # get the counts (this is a comment it&#39;s just here for you to read) counts &lt;- nyc_films %&gt;% group_by(SubCategoryName) %&gt;% summarize(count_of_permits = length(SubCategoryName)) # make the plot ggplot(counts, aes(x = SubCategoryName, y = count_of_permits, color=SubCategoryName, fill= SubCategoryName )) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + theme_classic(base_size = 10) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + ylab(&quot;Number of Film Permits&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Sub-category of film&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Number of Film permits in NYC by Sub-category&quot;) + theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;) I guess “episodic series” are the most common. Using a graph like this gave us our answer super fast. 12.2.6.2 Categories by different Boroughs Let’s see one more really useful thing about ggplot2. It’s called facet_wrap(). It’s an ugly word, but you will see that it is very cool, and you can do next-level-super-hero graph styles with facet_wrap that other people can’t do very easily. Here’s our question. We know that some films are made in different Boroughs, and that same films are made in different categories, but do different Boroughs have different patterns for the kinds of categories of films they request permits for? Are their more TV shows in Brooklyn? How do we find out? Watch, just like this: # get the counts (this is a comment it&#39;s just here for you to read) counts &lt;- nyc_films %&gt;% group_by(Borough,Category) %&gt;% summarize(count_of_permits = length(Category)) # make the plot ggplot(counts, aes(x = Category, y = count_of_permits, color=Category, fill= Category )) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + theme_classic(base_size = 10) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + ylab(&quot;Number of Film Permits&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Category of film&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Number of Film permits in NYC by Category and Borough&quot;) + theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;) + facet_wrap(~Borough, ncol=3) We did two important things. First we added Borough and Category into the group_by() function. This automatically gives separate counts for each category of film, for each Borough. Then we added facet_wrap(~Borough, ncol=3) to the end of the plot, and it automatically drew us 5 different bar graphs, one for each Borough! That was fast. Imagine doing that by hand. The nice thing about this is we can switch things around if we want. For example, we could do it this way by switching the Category with Borough, and facet-wrapping by Category instead of Borough like we did above. Do what works for you. ggplot(counts, aes(x = Borough, y = count_of_permits, color=Borough, fill= Borough )) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + theme_classic(base_size = 10) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + ylab(&quot;Number of Film Permits&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Borough&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Number of Film permits in NYC by Category and Borough&quot;) + theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;) + facet_wrap(~Category, ncol=5) 12.2.7 Gapminder Data https://www.gapminder.org is an organization that collects some really interesting worldwide data. They also make cool visualization tools for looking at the data. There are many neat examples, and they have visualization tools built right into their website that you can play around with https://www.gapminder.org/tools/. That’s fun check it out. There is also an R package called gapminder. When you install this package, it loads in some of the data from gapminder, so we can play with it in R. If you don’t have the gapminder package installed, you can install it by running this code install.packages(&quot;gapminder&quot;) Once the package is installed, you need to load the new library, like this. Then, you can put the gapminder data into a data frame, like we do here: gapminder_df. library(gapminder) gapminder_df&lt;-gapminder 12.2.7.1 Look at the data frame You can look at the data frame to see what is in it, and you can use summarytools again to view a summary of the data. view(dfSummary(gapminder_df)) There are 1704 rows of data, and we see some columns for country, continent, year, life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita. 12.2.8 Asking Questions with the gap minder data We will show you how to graph some the data to answer a few different kinds of questions. Then you will form your own questions, and see if you can answer them with ggplot2 yourself. All you will need to do is copy and paste the following examples, and change them up a little bit 12.2.8.1 Life Expectancy histogram How long are people living all around the world according to this data set? There are many ways we could plot the data to find out. The first way is a histogram. We have many numbers for life expectancy in the column lifeExp. This is a big sample, full of numbers for 142 countries across many years. It’s easy to make a histogram in ggplot to view the distribution: ggplot(gapminder_df, aes(x=lifeExp))+ geom_histogram(color=&quot;white&quot;) See, that was easy. Next, is a code block that adds more layers and settings if you wanted to modify parts of the graph: ggplot(gapminder_df, aes(x = lifeExp)) + geom_histogram(color=&quot;white&quot;)+ theme_classic(base_size = 15) + ylab(&quot;Frequency count&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Life Expectancy&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Histogram of Life Expectancy from Gapminder&quot;) The histogram shows a wide range of life expectancies, from below 40 to just over 80. Histograms are useful, they can show you what kinds of values happen more often than others. One final thing about histograms in ggplot. You may want to change the bin size. That controls how wide or narrow, or the number of bars (how they split across the range), in the histogram. You need to set the bins= option in geom_histogram(). ggplot(gapminder_df, aes(x = lifeExp)) + geom_histogram(color=&quot;white&quot;, bins=50)+ theme_classic(base_size = 15) + ylab(&quot;Frequency count&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Life Expectancy&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Histogram of Life Expectancy from Gapminder&quot;) See, same basic patter, but now breaking up the range into 50 little equal sized bins, rather than 30, which is the default. You get to choose what you want to do. 12.2.8.2 Life Expectancy by year Scatterplot We can see we have data for life expectancy and different years. So, does worldwide life expectancy change across the years in the data set? As we go into the future, are people living longer? Let’s look at this using a scatter plot. We can set the x-axis to be year, and the y-axis to be life expectancy. Then we can use geom_point() to display a whole bunch of dots, and then look at them. Here’s the simple code: ggplot(gapminder_df, aes(y= lifeExp, x= year))+ geom_point() Whoa, that’s a lot of dots! Remember that each country is measured each year. So, the bands of dots you see, show the life expectancies for the whole range of countries within each year of the database. There is a big spread inside each year. But, on the whole it looks like groups of dots slowly go up over years. 12.2.8.3 One country, life expectancy by year I’m (Matt) from Canada, so maybe I want to know if life expectancy for Canadians is going up over the years. To find out the answer for one country, we first need to split the full data set, into another smaller data set that only contains data for Canada. In other words, we want only the rows where the word “Canada” is found in the country column. We will use the filter function from dplyr for this: # filter rows to contain Canada smaller_df &lt;- gapminder_df %&gt;% filter(country == &quot;Canada&quot;) # plot the new data contained in smaller_df ggplot(smaller_df, aes(y= lifeExp, x= year))+ geom_point() I would say things are looking good for Canadians, their life expectancy is going up over the years! 12.2.8.4 Multiple countries scatterplot What if we want to look at a few countries altogether. We can do this too. We just change how we filter the data so more than one country is allowed, then we plot the data. We will also add some nicer color options and make the plot look pretty. First, the simple code: # filter rows to contain countries of choice smaller_df &lt;- gapminder_df %&gt;% filter(country %in% c(&quot;Canada&quot;,&quot;France&quot;,&quot;Brazil&quot;) == TRUE) # plot the new data contained in smaller_df ggplot(smaller_df, aes(y= lifeExp, x= year, group= country))+ geom_point() Nice, we can now see three sets of dots, but which are countries do they represent? Let’s add a legend, and make the graph better looking. ggplot(smaller_df,aes(y= lifeExp, x= year, group= country, color = country)) + geom_point()+ theme_classic(base_size = 15) + ylab(&quot;Life Expectancy&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Year&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Life expectancy by year for three countries&quot;) 12.2.8.5 geom_line() connecting the dots We might also want to connect the dots with a line, to make it easier to see the connection! Remember, ggplot2 draws layers on top of layers. So, we add in a new geom_line() layer. ggplot(smaller_df,aes(y= lifeExp, x= year, group= country, color = country)) + geom_point()+ geom_line()+ theme_classic(base_size = 15) + ylab(&quot;Life Expectancy&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Year&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Life expectancy by year for three countries&quot;) 12.2.9 Generalization Exercise The following generalization exercise and writing assignment is also in your lab R Markdown document for this lab. Complete your work in that document and hand it in. (1 point - Pass/Fail) Use the code from above to attempt to solve the extra things we ask you do for this assignment. You generalization exercises are as follows: Make a graph plotting Life Expectancy by year for the five continents, using the continent factor. Make sure you change the title so it reads correctly Make a graph plotting GDP per capita by year for the USA, Canada, and Mexico. Use the gdpPercap column for the GDP per capita data Make a new graph plotting anything you are interested in using the gapminder dataset. It just needs to be a plot that we have not given an example for 12.2.10 Writing assignment Complete the writing assignment described in your R Markdown document for this lab. When you have finished everything. Knit the document and hand in your stuff (you can submit your .RMD file to blackboard if it does not knit.) The question for this lab is a long answer question about histograms. Here is the question: Describe what histograms are, how to interpret them, and what they are useful for. You should answer each of these questions: The answers to each of these questions are worth .25 points each, for a total of 2 points What do the bars on a histogram represent? How many bars can a histogram have? What do the heights of the bars tell you What is on the x-axis and y-axis of a histogram What does the tallest bar on a histogram tell you? What does the shortest bar on a histogram tell you? What are some uses for histograms, why would you want to look at a histogram of some numbers that you collected? Imagine you had two histograms, one was very wide and spread out, the other was very narrow with a very tall peak. Which histogram would you expect to contain more consistent numbers (numbers that are close to each other), explain why. Rubric General grading. You will receive 0 points for missing answers (say, if you do not answer question c, then you will receive 0 out .25 points for that question) You must write in complete sentences. Point form sentences will be given 0 points. Completely incorrect answers will receive 0 points. For example, if you incorrectly describe what the x and y-axes refer to, then you will receive 0 points for that question. If your answer is generally correct but very difficult to understand and unclear you may receive half points for the question 12.3 Excel Have you ever gotten home (or to Brooklyn college) to find orange cones preventing you from parking because yet another film shoot has been issued a permit to take up the entire block with trucks and trailers? Today we are going to take a look at some data collected by the New York City government, about filming permits issued in the last several years. 12.3.1 Goals Today I will walk you through techniques to make several different types of graphs in excel, that will help us quickly visually summarize a large set of data. You will learn to: Count occurrences of variables in cells Make bar graphs of this data Construct a histogram using the data analysis tool pack Write a brief interpretation of our findings The data we will look at today contains 14 different variables of information about 50728 different film permits issued by the city in the last several years. That is a lot of data, and can be pretty intimidating at first glance. Trying to wrap our heads around any meaning of patterns in this data seems like a daunting task. This is why statistics and graphs are awesome. Statistics and graphs are short cuts that help complicated trends and patterns hidden in large sets of numbers become obvious to the human eye / brain. Before we get started, let’s load up the data, and you can see what I mean. 12.3.2 Load the data Download the data as a .csv file from section 1.3 above (INSERTLINK 1.3) Open the downloaded file in excel Save the file as an Excel document File → Save As… filetype: .xlsx name: personalize the file name so you will recognize this as your own copy of the data (maybe: Lab1_YourName) 12.3.3 Inspect the data When you open the Excel file, you will see many rows and columns of data. Each row (except row 1) contains data corresponding to one filming permit (what we might think of as a “subject” in this case). Row 1 however, contains the names of each variable, which we call the “Header” row. Each column contains data for a single variable, for every subject. Using the bar on the right edge of your screen, scroll through the data a bit and take a look. I’ll wait…. Did you find anything cool in there? Notice any patterns about where, when, how long film permits are issued for? No! Of course you didn’t! Right now our data is just a giant mess of numbers! Way too many numbers!!! This is the fundamental reason why graphs and statistics are awesome. We are going to distill meaning that is easily and quickly identifiable out of this hot mess of numbers. Our analysis goals for this walkthrough are: Create a bar graph that displays the number of permits issued in each borough. Create a bar graph that displays the number of each type of permit issued in Brooklyn. Create a histogram that displays the lengths of time that these permits are valid for. 12.3.4 Preparing the data 12.3.4.1 Creating blank worksheets First, we will create a blank worksheet for each of the graphs we will be producing today. Click the “+” button on the worksheet tab bar to create a new worksheet Right click on the new worksheets tab and select “rename” Give the sheet a meaningful name, maybe “BarGraph - Borough” Repeat steps 1-3 until you have 3 blank worksheets, one for each graph. Rename each one with a sensible name 12.3.4.2 Create a working copy of the data We will now copy to each of these sheets just the data we will need to complete each graph. In Excel, there are often many paths to the correct answer/graph/statistic. The method I am about to show you is very clean and organized, but as you get more experience with excel, you might find ways to take shortcuts and skip some of these steps For each of our 3 graphs, and 3 corresponding worksheets, we will need different variables: Graph Variables needed Bar graph by Borough Borough Bar graph by type, Brooklyn only Borough and Category Histogram of permit duration StartDateTime and EndDateTime Go to the worksheet named “Film_Permits” that contains the original data by clicking its’ name on the worksheet tab bar (near the bottom of your screen) click on the letter “H” above the column named “Borough”. This will select the entire column of data Press ctrl+c to copy this data to the clipboard (or right click the data you selected and then click “copy”) Go to the worksheet where you will create the first bar graph. Click cell “A1” Press ctrl+v to paste this data from the clipboard (or right click “the data you selected”A1&quot; and then click “paste”) Repeat this process until all three of your new worksheets contain the variables mentioned in the table above. 12.3.5 Bar graph by borough The first graph we create will be a bar graph. The (horizontal) x-axis of this graph will display each of the five boroughs. The vertical) y-axis of this graph will display the frequency, or number, of film permits issued per borough. 12.3.5.1 Calculate Values to graph First click the tab of the worksheet where you placed only the “Borough variable” to make that sheet active. In order to generate this graph, we first need to calculate how many permits were issued in each of the five boroughs. Starting in column C, Row 1, (as in Cell C1), write the name of one of the 5 boroughs. Let’s start with “Brooklyn”, because. In the cell to the right of C1, aka D1, write “Bronx”. Keep going to the right, and write the labels “Queens”, “Manhattan”, and “Staten Island” In cell C2, write or copy/paste the formula: =COUNTIF(A:A,C1) Press enter. You should now see that the cell C2 now displays 15389. This is the total number of film permits issued in Brooklyn over the past several years. The “CountIf” function takes two inputs, separated by a comma. The first input tells the function “Where should I count stuff?” and the second input tells the function “What should I count there?”. So “=COUNTIF(A:A,C1)” translates to “Search through the whole A column (A:A), and count each cell if it equals whatever is in cell C1 (Brooklyn)”. The help files inside excel are pretty great at explaining how different functions work. you can quickly access the help file on any function by type it into a cell and clicking its name. See the video below. Repeat this process to under each of the four other borough labels. You should end up with: 12.3.5.2 Create and customize the graph Now that we have our data, we can go about making our graph. Press down the left mouse button on C1 (where it says “Brooklyn”) and hold drag your mouse to the right until you have highlighted all five borough names, and down until you have selected both the labels and the data. Release the mouse button (I’m so glad I remembered to include this step. You could have ended up holding the mouse button down forever!). Click the “Insert” button on the menu ribbon near the top of your screen Click the “column chart” button to insert a column chart. And there we go! ’We have a bar graph! Now let’s play with some of the graphs options to make it look a little more presentable. Select your graph Click the “Design” button on the menu ribbon Click “add chart element”. From this menu you can add and remove features from your graph. Click “Axis labels” to add labels to both your vertical and horizontal axes. Now your graph will have the words “Axis title” along both the bottom and left edge. Click into these text boxes and give the axis a sensible label (maybe “Film Permits” and “Borough”) Play with the other settings and options in the design ribbon. There are a lot of options on how to present a graph. The most important thing to remember is that a graph should be as easy to read as possible. Try not to include things that are redundant, or don’t add to the point you are trying to make. On other words, this: Not this: 12.3.6 Bar graph by type, Brooklyn only Now we are going to make a similar graph, but this time we are going to look at the types of permits being issued, but only in Brooklyn (leaving the other lesser boroughs out of it for now). Because we only want to count each category in only one borough, we are going to have to use the =COUNTIFS function this time around. 12.3.6.1 Calculate Values to graph Click the second worksheet we created before, the one that we pasted the Borough and Category variables to. Create a label for each type of category, starting in cell D1 and moving to the right. (Commercial, Film, Still, Photography, Student, Television, Theater, WEB) Write “Brooklyn” in cell C1 in Cell D2, write the function: =COUNTIFS(A:A,C1,B:B,D1) Countifs will only count rows that meet all of its’ criteria. Its usage is =countifs(where to count 1 , what to count 1, where to count 2, what to count 2 ). The function we just entered translates to: Search through the borough variable (column A) and count all the rows that say “Brooklyn” (C1), then search through those rows in the category variable (column B), and count all the ones that say “Commercial” (D1) Remember to check out the excel help on countifs. Repeat this function for each of the other category labels (Television, etc.) your result should look like this: 12.3.6.2 Create and customize graph Highlight the data we just calculated Click the “Insert” button on the menu ribbon near the top of your screen Click the “column chart” button to insert a column chart. Give it axis labels, and make any other design changes you think make the graph easier to read. 12.3.7 Histogram of permit duration We will now make a histogram of the duration of each of these permits. A histogram is a lot like a bar graph, except histograms are used for continuous variables (like length of time), and bar graphs are used for categorical variables (like borough or category). The biggest visual difference is that the bars in a bar graph have space between them, while a histograms bars touch each other. 12.3.7.1 Install the data analysis toolbox We will use the data analysis toolbox to construct this graph. The data analysis toolbox is a free add on for Microsoft excel. Most university computers will already have this installed. To check if the data analysis toolbox is installed: Click “data” in the menu ribbon if the data tab contains a section called “analysis”, and a “data analysis” button, then the toolbox is installed, and you can proceed, if not follow these instructions to install the toolbox. 12.3.7.2 Calculate Values to graph Click the third worksheet we created before, the one that we pasted the Start Date and End Date variables to. In cell C2, to the right of the first start/end date pair, type the formula: =B2-A2 Subtracting the start data from the end date will give us the number of days the permit was issued for. a value of “.25” means that the permit was valid for 6 hours (.25 * 24 hours in a day) Now we need to copy paste the formula into column C next to each row of data. But since this data set holds over 50,000 rows, selecting all of that data manually would be tedious. I’m going to use so keyboard shortcuts here, that make it ver easy to move around large sets of data in excel. Start by click the cell we want to copy (C2, where we put the subtraction formula) press ctrl+c to copy that formula. Press the left arrow once to move to cell B2 Hold the ctrl button and press the down arrow. This will “jump” the cursor down to the end of the data. When you hold ctrl, arrow keys move the cursor to the last piece of data in that row or column, before a blank cell. Now release the ctrl button, and press the right arrow once, moving the highlighted cell to C50729. Hold ctrl+shift+up arrow. This makes the cursor jump back up to our formula, and holding shift make it highlight all cells between the start and end of the jump press ctrl+V to paste our formula in the cells we just selected. Learning to use the arrow keys, ctrl, and shift to move around and highlight data in Excel can turn a 2 hour analysis into a 20 minute analysis, and is a great skill to practice. An Excel champion very rarely needs to touch their mouse. 12.3.7.3 Create and customize graph 12.3.7.3.1 Create bin labels Now that we have the duration of each permit, we can start to put it together for use in a histogram. In order to do this, we will need to define the “bins” (x-axis units) of our histogram. In cell E2 type the number “0” Now in the cell below 0, write the formula = E2+.1 Copy this formula in the spaces below, until the final result = 3 (days) 12.3.7.3.2 Data analysis toolbox - Histogram Click the “data” button in the menu ribbon Click the “data analysis” button Select the “histogram” option Next to “input range”, click the cell selection button Using the mouse, click the label “C” at the top of the column containing the permit duration values. Press enter Next to “Bin Range”, click the cell selection button Using the mouse, highlight the bin values we created in step 3. Press enter Make sure the check mark next to “Chart output” is selected In the output section, select “New Worksheet” and enter a name (maybe “Permit Duration - Histogram”) Press enter Excel will now create a new worksheet that has a frequency table, using the bins we provided, and a histogram of that data. We could have created this chart the hard way, using a =COUNTIF function, but the data analysis toolbox did a lot of the work for us in this example. Now you can edit the visual appearance of the graph. At the very least, we need to make all the bars touch one another, to make it clear to that this is a histogram and not a bar graph. Right click on one of the bars of the graph and select “Format data series” In the window that appears, set “gap width” to 0 12.3.8 Reporting and interpreting our results Figure 1 Figure 1 shows the number of film permits issued in each of the last 5 boroughs over the last several years. From this graph we can see that in Manhattan and Brooklyn, over 15000 permits have been issued over this period. Queens has also had a high number of permits issued, Whilre very few permits have been issued in the Bronx and Staten Island. Figure 2 Figure 2 shows the number of film permits issued in Brooklyn, broken down by category of permit. Here we can see that the vast majority of filming that goes on in Brooklyn is for television projects, with film projects a distant second. Figure 3 Figure 3 is a histogram of the duration of time that film permits issued in NYC are valid for between .6 and .7 days. This number makes sense, as that is the approximate length of an average working day. The data set contains ~ 1000 outliers, which are permits in the “more than 3 days” category. 12.3.9 On Your Own Create a bar graph that shows the frequency of each category of film permit across all five boroughs. Create 4 more bar graphs of the frequency of each category of film permit in each of the other four borough (beside the one we already made for Brooklyn) Create a histogram of the time between the date a permit was entered into the NYC system (EnteredOn) and the start date of the permit (StartDateTime) In one to two pages, discuss what you see in these graphs, and what you can learn about film permits in NYC with all the graphs you made today. Be sure to label each graph, and make specific references in your text to each of the graphs, explaining how/what that graph has to say. 12.4 SPSS In this lab, we will get you acquainted with the SPSS software layout and graph some sample data to make sense of it. We will be doing the following: Opening SPSS and the SPSS layout Reviewing variable properties and the Variable View tab Opening a data file and producing different types of graphs 12.4.1 Opening SPSS and the SPSS layout Your lab instructor will take you through the process of opening the SPSS program. You may double-click on its icon located on the desktop of your lab computer, or you may find it using the Start menu. Once the program loads, you will be prompted with a pop-up window that asks you which file you would like to open. For now, we will be examining the basic layout of SPSS without a data set, so you can click Cancel. Once you do, the main SPSS spreadsheet should open. It will look like this, a basic spreadsheet: Figure 12.1: Empty SPSS spreadsheet Notice at the bottom of your window there are two tabs; “Data View” and “Variable View”. In data view, we enter data into our spreadsheet. You will notice that rows are numbered on the left-hand side of the spreadsheet, while columns are labeled “var”. This is an indication of the general structure of SPSS: Variables are contained in the columns, and rows indicate individual observations. For example, if you obtained the heights (in inches) of 5 people {x= 64, 70, 63, 62, 65} and wanted to enter their data into SPSS, each person’s height would be entered in a new row, not across the columns, as seen below: 12.4.2 Reviewing variable properties and the Variable View tab Now that we have some data entered, we might want to name our variable so that it’s evident our measurements represent heights. In order o view or modify variable names and other properties, look to the bottom of your SPSS window and switch over to the “Data View” tab. Once you do this, your window will appear as follows: Here, you can edit the name of your variables, and specify their properties. Variable names can be anything you like, with the restriction that you cannot use numbers or spaces. Next, notice several other important properties of variables you may at some point need to set or modify: Name: the name of your variable that will appear as a colum header in Data View. No spaces or numerals. Type: Your data will most often be Numeric, but sometimes, as in data representing currency or data in scientific notation, you may change the data type appropriately. If your data is simply a label, word, or response (such as an open-ended response to a survey question), choose “String”: this tells SPSS not to treat this variable as a number. (Nota bene: if you select the wrong type of variable, SPSS may not be able to process your requested calculations, so always remember to check this parameter!) Width: This refers to how many digits will be visible by default. Decimals: This refers to how many decimal places will be visible by default. Label: This is a description of the variable. Any information too long to be included in the variable name goes here. Values: For nominal scale data, let’s say 1 represents male and 2 represents female, this is where you include the values and their corresponding labels. Measure: This variable property allows you to specify the nature of your data. Depending on the kind of scale you are using, you will choose a different measure type. Nominal and ordinal are chosen for nominal and ordinal scales, respectively. “Scale” is used when your data is measured on a ratio or interval scale. (Nota bene: this “Measure” designation is only a marker; it does not affect the calculations as in the “Type” parameter. Even if you choose the wrong icon/label for “Measure”, SPSS will still produce the correct output) 12.4.3 Opening a data file and producing different types of graphs Now that we know about the properties of the SPSS spreadsheet window, let’s open a data file and learn how to make some sense of it by creating different types of graphs. Here is a link to an SPSS-based data file containing information about film permits (requests made by film companies to shoot TV shows and movies on location) filed in New York City. The file is named nyc_films.sav. Once you open the data file, browse through to familiarize yourself with the variables that are being measured. Switch over to Variable View for details of each variable. 12.4.3.1 Bar Graphs Now, back to Data View. We will not be working with every single variable in this spreadsheet, but we’ll select a few interesting ones with which to answer questions. Let’s start with borough. Suppose we wanted to know which borough receives the most film permits (you can probably guess which one is most popular). Let’s use SPSS to produce a graph to answer this question. With your data file open, go up to the top menu and choose Graphs, then Legacy Dialogs. You will see an entire list of possible graphs we can use to plot our data. Let’s think about the nature of our question: we would like to know how many permits were filed for each borough. Borough is simply a label or a name for a region, and we want to know the frequency of permits for each borough. This is a nominal scale variable and so, we will appropriately choose a BAR graph to plot it. Select Bar… The next window will ask you to specify what kind of graph you would like. Select Simple and then Define. The following window will ask which variable you’d like to plot. Select borough from the left-hand list and use the arrow to move it into the field labeled “Category Axis”. Then click OK. SPSS will produce a new output window which will contain the bar graph you have generated. Notice which borough receives the most film permits. Are you surprised? 12.4.3.2 Histograms Now, let’s use a different data set to plot a histogram. The defining difference between a histogram and a bar graph (although they look very similar as they both utilize bars) is that a histogram is used to display a continuous variable (interval or ratio scale). In the previous example, boroughs were simply labels or names, so we used a nominal scale and therefore a bar graph. Here, we will deal with life expectancy (measured in years), an interval scale measure. Here is a link to the SPSS data file, life_expectancy.sav. Open this file and examine its rows and columns. Each column represents a year during which life expectancy was measured. Each row represents a different country. Let’s first get an idea about life expectancy in general. We want to plot a histogram with life expectancy on the x-axis and frequency on the y-axis. Choose Graphs in the top menu, then Legacy Dialogs. From here, remember we want a histogram, not a bar graph, so let’s select Histogram…. The window that appears contains every variable in your spreadsheet listed on the left-hand side. We can choose one variable at a time to plot. Let’s scroll all the way down the list and choose 2017 [v219]. This is the variable containing life expectancies for the year 2017. Using the arrow, move that variable into the field labeled “Variable:”, then click OK. SPSS will produce an output window containing the distribution of life expectancy for the year 2017. 12.4.3.3 Scatterplots Now, we will look to a different type of data plot; the scatterplot. A scatterplot allows us to visualize bivariate data, that is, data for which there are two measurements per individual. For example, we may ask whether life expectancy in a country (or how long you live, on average) is related to the average income. Using the life_expectancy.sav data file, let’s plot both variables: 2017 [v219] and income. The income variable in the spreadsheet refers to data collected in 2017 by the Better Life Initiative. Notice not all the countries listed have estimates for average annual income. For those that do, this value represents household net adjusted income (annual) in US dollars. To create the scatterplot, let’s go to Graphs in the menu toolbar, then Legacy Dialogs, then Scatter. You will choose Simple scatter, then click Define. Next, indicate which variables (there are 2 this time!) you would like in the x- and y-axes. Use the arrows to place income in the x-axis field, and 2017 (V219) in the y-axis field. (For the purposes of graphing a scatterplot, it does not matter which variable goes into the y-axis and x-axis fields for now; you can reverse them if you’d like and you can still interpret the data similarly) Then click OK. SPSS will produce output containing a scatterplot. What relationship do you notice? What happens to life expectancy the more individuals earn, on average? 12.4.4 Practice Problems Create a histogram for life expectancy in the year 1800. Describe the distribution. How does it differ from the one we plotted for 2017? Plot the life expectancy of each country in 1800 vs. that of 2018. What does this graph show you? What are your conclusions regarding the development of nations? 12.5 JAMOVI "],
